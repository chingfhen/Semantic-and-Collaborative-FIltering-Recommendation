    "- this code tries out the pipeline: query>filter by genre and quantized vector>candidate books\n",
    "- background:\n",
    "    - in previous notebooks, i experimented with many ways to semantically narrow down candidate space given a query\n",
    "    - this notebok puts the most promising attempts together\n",
    "- approach:\n",
    "    - given a query\n",
    "        - semantically guess the users desired genres\n",
    "        - semantically match users query to book summaries\n",
    "- steps:\n",
    "    - given a query\n",
    "        1. guess desired genres:\n",
    "            - convert to embedding - phrase bert model used - accounts for lexically dissimilarity\n",
    "            - retrieve genre embedding matrix from mongo\n",
    "            - apply matrix multiplication\n",
    "            - get top k most similar genres with highest similarity scores\n",
    "        2. match user query to book summary:\n",
    "            - convert to embedding - a sentence transformer used - produces quality sentence embeddings\n",
    "            - convert to quantized vector\n",
    "    - retrieve documents that:\n",
    "        - have at least 1 matching genre\n",
    "        - or have at least one matching quantized id\n",
    "        \n",
    "- motivation and advantages:\n",
    "    - filtering by genre produces results that tends to stay within topic, but may lead to a large number of results\n",
    "    - filtering semantically by summary can produce a smaller set of results but there tends to be a lot of noise i.e undesired results may also appear\n",
    "    - using both methods together yields a smaller set of results that also stick within desired topics\n",
    "    - both methods are designed to be efficient, at low memory cost:\n",
    "        - using matrix multication to get desired genres\n",
    "        - using product quantization we reduce the embedding sizes and remove the need to loop through mongo database and compute dot product \n",
    "- outcome:\n",
    "    - filtering only by genre produces too many results, many have summaries that are semantically dissimilar to the user's query\n",
    "    - filtering by only product quantization produces a small set of results, but some appear irrelevant\n",
    "    - filtering by both genre and product quantization produces the least results, yet the result summaries are semantically similar to the users query\n",
    "    - this shows to an extent the **our pipeline is effective in yielding a small set of results that are also semantically similar**"

       " 'Review': [\"Sister John is a Carmelite nun who, after years of dedicated service, begins to experience visions of the divine in ecstatic, crystalline clarity. But these visions are accompanied by terrible headaches, and Sister John is encouraged to seek medical attention. When told by a neurologist that her experiences are likely the result of (curable) epileptic seizures, Sister John is forced to rethink everything she knows about spiritual life.On the surface, this seems like a(nother) religion vs. science narrative. But, this isn't simply a matter of conflicting paradigms. That's the easy part. It's the human element, the choices we have to make on our own that are difficult.Sister John is genuinely good and genuinely selfless. She's so selfless and good, I very nearly abandoned the book! I couldn't relate to her. I felt Mark Salzman was keeping too much of a respectful distance. But, as the story develops, we begin to see Sister John's frailty, her human fallibility. And, yes, her . When the most meaningful experiences of her life are reduced to a neurological defect, your heart breaks for her. Salzman sees the beauty in her vocation...but he doesn't romanticize it.He's not trying to make Catholicism hip, . He's not trying to make it sexy, . He just wrote a beautiful, poignantly human narrative. And, you don't have to be Catholic to appreciate it.\",\n",
       "  \"I enjoyed this book immensely. It is the fictional story of Sister John of the Cross. Sister John is a member of a Carmelite monastery on the outskirts of Los Angeles. For many years Sister John has struggled to find true knowledge of God, her spouse, she wants to feel his presence. After waiting for such a long time for an answer she starts having headaches, along with the pain comes joy, she starts having visions, she feels that her prayers and patience have been answered. Sister John is even inspired to write a bestselling book. Whilst she is having one of her spells she sees the world differently, she sees beauty in all the small things in nature in the semi desert garden but most of all Sr. John has met the Divine.As the pains intensify it is deemed necessary by Sister John's superiors that she sees a doctor and she is faced with a life changing decision, keep her pain (and the disturbance to the lives of her sisters) or have surgery and lose her precious gift.All of Sister John's thoughts are printed in italics and you feel really a part of her struggle. Her gift has been her consolation over the last few years and also a great benefit to the monastery.This is such a peaceful story and yet it drew me into asking so many questions!If such an illness results in wonderful inspired writing is it wrong to assume that the inspiration does not come from the Holy Spirit? If it is just the illness speaking through Sister John why is it not just gobbledygook? Why are her writings so beautiful and wise? Was the gift maybe given by God to help Sister John through an impossibly hard time on her religious journey?So many ifs and buts in an inspirational story, when we learn what Sister John decides we then have to see what the outcome will be, will all be well with her and the community?\",\n",
       "  'Protagonist Sister John of the Cross is a Carmelite nun living in a convent near Los Angeles. In 1982, she has been there for thirteen years and is going through a “spiritual desert.” She then starts experiencing a vast period of creativity, writing poetry for hours at night, and publishing a book on the contemplative life. This is a period of spiritual awakening. Sister John believes these new visions and out of body sensations are a consequence of her faith. As she pours water into a bowl, This is an unusual novel that looks at the relationship between the sense of self, mind, and soul. It explores the relationship between the spiritual self and neural functioning of the brain, as she is eventually diagnosed with a neurological condition. She must then decide whether or not to treat this condition medically, and if she does, whether she risks becoming another person entirely from the person she believes herself to be. She does not want to let go of her mystical experiences, and her creative writing, which she sees as giving meaning to her life.She consults a doctor and a priest, but neither is particularly sensitive to her dilemma. It is important to note that Sister John of the Cross decided upon this name after the Spanish mystic and poet, Saint John of the Cross, author of the poem ‘‘Dark Night of the Soul.’ Sister John must navigate her own “dark night” as she decides whether or not to go down the medical path. From reading psychology, I understand that this is a very real problem for many individuals. Inner life and imagination can be released through many outside influences, including disease and neurological dysfunction. The person’s sense of the self is intimately involved, and it is difficult to separate what is internally originated versus externally imposed. They may resist being “cured.” This short novel engages readers in exploring the spiritual dimensions of the self. The author has brilliantly illustrated Sister John’s desires, doubts, fears, and internal struggles. It depicts monastic life in a much more realistic manner than some I have read recently. I do not think one needs to be a follower of religion to appreciate this book and empathize with Sister John. I found it extremely thought-provoking. I am stopping now before I write a review that is longer than the book!',\n",
       "  'Have you ever  to know God? I mean really  Him, feel close to Him, sense His presence within or near you? Sister John of the Cross, a cloistered Carmelite of middle age, waited for many dry years to know her Bridegroom. Then a few years ago she started having migraine-like headaches. With the onset of the headaches, she became able to engage in deep meditation and began having Divine encounters, which led to a best-selling book and notoriety for her convent just outside Los Angeles. However, as the severity of head pain continued to increase, Sister John was forced to seek medical attention which led to a disappointing medical diagnosis and an especially difficult decision for this theophilus, lover of God.   is a gentle, yet powerful story, more poem than prose. The book is organized around the liturgical calendar and rich in Catholic symbolism, which is why—even though it  be read quickly—it is best appreciated at leisure. In the end it is less about how she resolves her medical dilemma than what she learns spiritually, which hopefully is the case for all of us. Savor it. Better yet, take any one of Sister John’s thoughts—they are all in italics—as a rich source for your daily meditation. Excellent!',\n",
       "  'I ended up liking this book a whole lot more than I thought I was while I was reading it. In fact, when I wasn\\'t reading it, I would think about something in it that seemed to resonate with me. For example, I thought it interesting to think that \"God loves each of us as if there were no one else on earth. Believing that is the most perfect act of faith of all.\"The book is about a nun who finds out after years of feeling like she was directly experiencing God\\'s presence that she had epilepsy and that most of what she felt was due to her seizures. She has a surgery to eliminate the problem and wonders whether she should return. After all, wasn\\'t it just the epilepsy that caused her to feel so intimate with God? I particularly loved the ending. Because all the nuns admitted to doubting their decisions to devote their lives to God. But they were still there, trying. And that was the point to it all. And isn\\'t that the point to what any of us who believes in God do? It takes so much more to keep saying \"yes\" to doing things when we don\\'t have a complete faith. As Mother Emmanuel said to Sister John, \"Yet you\\'re still here, trying to do His will anyway. That\\'s the kind of understanding I meant. The doing kind, not the knowing kind.\" One other quote from the book I liked was this: \". . . no matter how many times we hear what it costs to follow Christ, we\\'re still shocked when the bill comes, and we wonder all over again if we can pay it. If we make an act of faith then, it counts more than on the days when we feel sure.\"  '],\n",

These are all important things for providing worthwhile historical accounts of real events. The negatives are that D'Este focuses way too much on strategy rather than actual actions and what the events were like, he gets bogged down in providing a dozen corroborating sources when only three or four are needed, and he manages to strip away all of the emotion and drama of the events. It was informative but I prefer accounts that draw me in.\",\n",
      "        \"This is not a history of the Normandy campaign; rather, it\\u2019s an examination of the command decisions and some, not all, of the operations within. Of the landings, only Sword Beach is covered in detail. The taking of Cherbourg is not covered; we just know it happened. I wish the Cobra breakthrough received a more detailed accounting. It may help a reader to look at Wikipedia, or read Hastings\\u2019 or Beevor\\u2019s accounts before to learn more of the whole campaign.The author critically examines General Montgomery and the British army\\u2019s actions during this campaign and finds much to fault. The army suffers from failure of coordination and a lack of manpower at the strategic level. The author takes Monty to task with an in-depth examination of what he claimed to do, or was going to do, and what he actually did. There was a difference! Chapter 26 on the Falaise action (or lack of it) was hard to follow, yet the failure to close the pocket wasn\\u2019t fatal. So what\\u2019s the point? The campaign was finally a success, wasn\\u2019t it? True, it didn\\u2019t enhance Monty\\u2019s reputation, but the author gives him points for his overall excellence in training and planning. Readers familiar with Alamein and the action at the Mareth Line know that Monty could flex when he needed to. There were times when I wondered this could be as mean-spirited as David Irving\\u2019s , yet overall there is enough excellent history of the command decisions that had to be made to make this book well worth reading.\",\n",
      "        \"There is detail here and to the extent that the book explores the decision making process that formed a battle plan, and then evaluates how it played out, it is thought provoking for those interested in military strategy. However as others have surely said, there is a repetitive refrain here about how FoS Monty was, that comes back again and again. It would be an interesting if tiresome exercise to pick out how many times we are re-informed in a single-line sentence that Monty was inclined to arrange the facts to fit the story he wished to put forward. As if the reader needed to be reacquainted with the thesis statement periodically, just in case he forgot the thrust of case being built throughout so many sections of the book.I'm no expert in the field, but there does appear to be a trend in scholarship in harmony with what seemed to be Monty's long lived quest after the war - to rewrite the common evaluation of his generalship more favorably. This book is steadfastly, repetitively on the other side of that argument.Having said that, no one including D'Este sees Monty as any sort of massive failure as a strategist in what was ultimately a successful invasion and break out. And really, how much fault lies with the commander when the battle plans are implemented in such a way that the objectives are not met, as was the case in many operations aimed at taking Caen? It does seem that Monty was an inveterate fudger, spinner, slanter and credit taker throughout his career and his inconsistencies with facts on the ground appear to be whoppers. Hard not to concede that there was a pattern there. But what we may sometimes fail to appreciate is that his was a thankless job with many factors to balance (Ike-like, if you will) including war weariness at home and on the line, a man power shortage (however you regard the claim/efficacy of the 100k reserve on the British mainland), an incredible ability on the part of the enemy to resist in the face of dwindling resources and unprecedented bombardment and...general heavy sledding as regards of the taking of objectives. Plus, with the end of the war on the horizon, no one above him in the UK establishment would have welcomed boat rocking or anything that would weaken their hand in post war negotiations. What he did do was keep the situation together in a way that bent but did not break - he prevented disaster - so that the inexorable build up of numbers close to the coast where the allies could exercise the key tactical advantages of air superiority/naval and artillery bombardment would eventually reveal the opportunity for a coup de gr\\u00e2ce and win the day. Be that as it may, a good and informative book on the Normandy invasion if you can tolerate the repetitious, unvarying barrage of criticism of the manner of Monty's fighting and, more to the point, characterizing the war.\"\n",
