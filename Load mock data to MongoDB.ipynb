       "  'reviews': [\"This is a review of the Kindle Paperwhite launched July 2015. Essentially. the same as the previous Kindle Paperwhite but with a fantastic upgraded (300 dpi) screen, more memory and storage it's a terrific reading device. This review aims to describe both this product, and compare it with the other Kindle devices available to help you choose the best one for you.Before I start, Ive noticed several complains about Kindle not supporting the ePub format used by Canadian public libraries. Dont be put off, theres a solution in the Frequently Asked Questions section below.This review is broken up into sections so you can skip the less interesting bits. If youre in a hurry Ive included a summary at the start, and a Frequently Asked Questions section at the end.Summary - What can you do with it-----------------------------------------* Read a book. It can store 1,000s of books - take an entire library away with you on holiday.* Buy a book. You can browse the Amazon kindle store, and buy books over a WIFI connection* Borrow a book. Using the Kindle Owners Library you can borrow one of 60,000 books (if you have Amazon Prime Membership)* Share your books. Using Amazon Family Library to link two Amazon accounts and four children and share your books with the entire family* Highlight a section. Using the touch screen, you can highlight a particulary interesting few lines. If several people highlight the same section, that's also indicated.* Record a bookmark. To come back to it later* Read a book on your Kindle, continue on your smartphone or tablet computer, and it will jump to your last known position* Look up a word, and record them in the vocabulary builder* Track a characters appearance throughout a book using the X Ray feature.* Read for weeks without needing to recharge - typically 4-6 weeks* Share you books (Multiple Kindles on the same account, or family sharing)* Access every book you've ever owned on the cloud - available for download within seconds over WIFI or 3G..What Devices are available--------------------------------As of July 2015, Amazon have the following Kindle devices on sale:-1. Kindle 6 (around CDN 79)2. Kindle Paperwhite 6th Generation (212 dpi - launched October 2013) - around CDN 1292. New Kindle Paperwhite 7th Gen (300 dpi - launched July 2015) - around CDN 139-2093. Kindle Voyger - around US 219-289 (Doesnt seem to be on sale in Amazon Canada)4. Kindle Fire - 6 or 7 colour tablet computers at around CDN 300-400So you're faced with a few devices, plus additional options. Which to buy Here's a quick summary in order of cost.*** The entry level Kindle ***An entry level black and white (e-ink) book reader, it has a 6 inch touch screen with enough storage to hold thousands of books, and a battery which should last around 4 weeks.A terrific device to read books, and a worthy contender. For the technically minded, it has a 1Ghz processor and 4Gb of memory with an E-ink display. Essentially this means it's (a) Black and White (b) Fantastic to read even in bright sunlight (c) Requires very little power - hence the battery lasts for weeks instead of hours.*** New Kindle Paperwhite ***Launched in 2015, this is really an upgrade adding a super-sharp display with 300 pixels per inch - the same as the top of the range Voyage. The high resolution screen does provide a crisp text which is pleasing to the eye, but battery life is reduced from 8 weeks of the original Paperwhite to 6 weeks - but still a very long time.Compared to the existing (2013) Paperwhite it also includes double the memory which means its faster and slicker than before, and a new Bookerly font plus better presentation of fonts on screen.If you have an existing Paperwhite its probably not worth upgrading. However, if you own a prior device, youll notice the huge leap in screen quality, contrast and performance.*** The Voyage ***Far more expensive that Paperwhite, this is thinner and 26g lighter. It has more of a quality feel with the screen flush with the e-reader body which makes it look more like a tablet, and keeps dirt from getting caught in the edges. The back has a soft touch plastic finish which feels lovely in the hand, and it has new Page Press buttons on the side to turn the pages. When the buttons are pressed theres a gentle vibration for feedback (nice touch). It has 4Gb of storage (same as the Paperwhite), and a similar battery which should last around 6 weeks on a single charge.Although it has the same sharp (300 dpi) screen as the Paperwhite, the backlight includes an ambient light sensor so it automatically adjusts to different lighting conditions. This means if you read it the dark it will automatically adjust the brightness so it doesnt look too bright. In addition, youll find when you switch off the room light your eyes naturally become accustomed to the darkness. To compensate, the Voyage automatically softens the light slightly. A lovely example of attention to detail in this premium device.*** Kindle Fire Tablet Computer ***The Kindle Fire range is a very different beast to the rest of the Kindle range. Similar to the Apple iPad mini, it has a high resolution screen, a fast processor and lots of memory with a colour screen and a much shorter battery life - hours rather than weeks. Although you can read books on a Fire using the Amazon Kindle App, youll find the Kindle with its sharp black and white screen far more like reading a physical book. Youll find it produces less eye strain, and whereas a tablet computer is better suited to surfing the web, watching videos and reading eMails, the Kindle is a dedicated book reader device.Unlike a Kindle, the Fire produces light at the blue end of the spectrum which means it may make it harder for you to sleep. The Paperwhite and Voyage also ave the advantage of a soft white back-light which is far more suited to reading in bed, and it wont for example, wake your partner if reading in the dark.Finally, unlike the rest of the Kindle range, the Fire is almost useless in bright sunlight so while its fine for everyday use, its less useful on holiday. The Kindle range of devices are perfect to take away on holiday as they can carry thousands of books, and are a pleasure to read even in bright sunlight.What other options do I have----------------------------------Having decided upon the model (Kindle, Paperwhite, Voyage or Fire), the next decision is around:-* Special Offers - ie. adverts* 3G or WIFI connectionPersonally I have no issue with adverts on a Kindle. They only appear on screen when the screen saver is on, and are not at all distracting.The 3G option is a more difficult question. This effectively means you can use your kindle to buy or download books over-the-air instead of at home or near a WIFI hotspot. Personally I went for the WIFI model as the saving is considerable, but its a personal choice. Of course if you wont have WIFI at home, then youll need the 3G option.One point worth mentioning however, is if you have a modern smartphone, you can always create a Personal Hotspot or local WIFI signal that your Kindle (or indeed any other WIFI device) can connect to. Got to Settings Personal Hotspot on your mobile to set one up, and you can connect your WIFI only Kindle while youre out and about.Conclusion-------------If you love books but your on a budget, the original Kindle with WIFI and special offers is a great option. Youll still be able to carry thousands of book around with you, but youll lose out on the soft white back-light and super crisp display of the Papwerwhite.The Kindle Paperwhite is your next best option and is a terrific device for reading with a superb 300 dpi super-sharp screen. Finally, theres the top of the range Voyage with the page press buttons and ambient light sensor which automatically adjusts the brightness.If youre in the market for a Tablet Computer then the Kindle Fire range is worth considering, but youll get a better book reading experience on the Kindle. Myself I have both a Paperwhite and an iPad Air 2. I was skeptical at first, but the Kindle is a perfect device for reading with one hand (on the train), and the back-light and long battery life a huge bonus.Frequently Asked Questions---------------------------------Q: What file format will a Kindle readA: Kindle Format 8 (AZW3), Kindle (AZW), TXT, PDF, unprotected MOBI, PRC natively in addition to HTML, DOC, DOCX, JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP through conversionQ: What It doesnt support EPUB formatA: No - but you can convert your EPUB books using a freely available program called Calibre. Simple search for You Tube um0teoAR6zw and youll see a video explaining how to do this. Simples.Q: If I lose my Kindle, do I lose my books as wellA: No. All books are available on your Amazon account to download on a new device.Q: Can I save my place in the bookA: Yes. It will automatically save your place, and if you resume on other device it will prompt you to jump to that position.Q: I often need reading glasses - can I adjust the font sizeA: Yes. Theres a range of fonts, and sizes to suit all tastesQ: Can I share books with my partner or childrenA: Yes. You can now share your books using Amazon Family Library to link two Amazon accounts and four children and share your books with the entire familyQ. Can I use a Kindle to read in bedA. Yes. But only on the Paperwhite and Voyage models. Its a pleasure to read in the dark with a soft white light. For the base Kindle model youll need the light onQ. Are there any free books availableA. Yes! Over 40,000 classic titles are available for free (out of copyright), and they can be legally downloaded. If you have a Amazon Prime membership you can also borrow a book from the Kindle Owners Library which includes around 60,000 books.Q: How long does the battery lastA: Depending upon model, you should get between 4 and 6 weeks between charges on around 30 minutes of reading per day. Ive certainly found Ive gone for weeks without charging the deviceQ: How long does it take to chargeA: From absolutely flat, around 4 hoursQ: How many books will the Kindle holdA: Literally thousands. You can also download every book youve ever owned from your Amazon account - so the list is quite literally unlimited.Q: Do I need anything elseA: Youll need a smartphone charger or laptop with a USB socket as the Kindle range doesnt come with a charger (but the Fire does). Amazon also offer an additional charger to buy if you need it. Some people also buy a cover, but I think this is not really needed. It adds to the weight, and is not really needed. It will protect your Kindle from a drop however, and protect the screen if its left knocking around in a bag.\"],\n",

It is very easy to read books in it. I LOVE the dictionary on this little device. Normally I just skip a word I don't know the meaning of and try to guess what it means in the context but with kindle, I just press and hold my finger on the word I don't know and translation pops up! so essentially, the meaning of a new word is at your finger tips! )If you love to read books, I highly recommend kindle.However, if you only read Manga or Comic books, if you are a fan of buying how to draw, how to sew books I do not recommend kindle for you. It is not easy to navigate trough pictures and slides.So if you are a fan of reading novels just buy it now!If you are a manga fan, just buy your manga books from bookstores.\"],\n",

I own an iPad, an iPhone, and have owned a Windows-based phone in the past that I used as an ereader.My overall impression of the device is good.The good:I'd honestly rather read linear (read from page one to the end, one page at a time) fiction from it than a book, because I can't always get comfortable with a book. Hardcovers are sometimes a bit heavy, and paperbacks don't always lie open easily. The Kindle is incredibly light and thin. I can hold it in one hand easily. The page turn buttons are conveniently located. Page-turns aren't instant, but they're probably quicker than turning a physical page in a printed book (there are just a lot more page-turns unless you choose a small font). The contrast is better than other ereaders I've seen. There is zero eye strain in good light. My eyesight isn't the greatest and I like being able to increase the font size and read without glasses. I love being able to browse the Kindle store and read samples before deciding to purchase. The experimental browser is surprisingly usable, but isn't great. It is useful for browsing wikipedia and blogs. The biggest drawback to the browser is the awkward pointer navigation, using the 5-way pad. It syncs your furthest read page over the internet so you can pick up where you left off using your iPhone or iPad.The so-so:The kindle store could use more categories and sorting options. You can't sort by top rated, and there is no category for alternate histories, for example. Finding a very-specific type of fiction relies on keyword searches, which don't do a great job. The wifi sometimes doesn't connect before it times-out.Read more\"],\n",

       "  'reviews': [\"I woke up to a nice surprise this morning: a new kindle as a gift. I have an iPad and a Kindle DX, but I guess someone heard my complaints of them being too heavy and difficult to do extended-reading on. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love my iPad and DX, but this new generation of Kindle is perfect for reading outside and for long periods of time. The iPad gets completely washed out in sunlight and often irritates my eyes staring at it for more than a couple of hours. The DX was my go-to device for those extended/outdoor reading periods, but now I have a new friend for reading novels. Instead of a replacement, this one seems more like a companion to the other devices and is a different class. The iPad works great for web browsing, shopping, productivity, games, etc while the Kindle falls short in those areas. The Kindle works great for reading novels, where the iPad falls short. For those that love to do extended-reading of magazines, newspapers, research articles, etc, I find that the DX is the go-to device.Without a doubt, the size and weight of the new kindle is the biggest draw for me. It's smaller than the last edition by a significant margin. I've played around with the Kindle 2 and was impressed, but now looking at the size of the new Kindle, I'm blown away. It's the absolute perfect size. Smaller would be unmanageable and larger wouldn't feel nearly as good. This is a device that you can hold up, read, and just forget that it's there. Compared to other e-readers I've tried, it's much smaller and much lighter.One of my biggest complaints about the previous generation Kindles and the DX is the speed. It sometimes takes a while after you push next page' for it to actually change.Read more\"],\n",

There are newer models: the basic, cheapie Kindle and the Kindle Touch, and of course the Kindle Fire quasi-tablet.br /br /Each of these models is an excellent choice. Whichever one is right for you just depends on your preferences.br /br /The 3 e-ink Kindles are Kindle Keyboard (this one), Kindle Touch (the newest flagship model), and the basic Kindle. All 3 of them have EXACTLY THE SAME 6 DISPLAY, with the same sharp typeface and high contrast that reads like ink on paper with no eyestrain. The Kindle Keyboard is the oldest of these models, and I got one of the first ones when they came out in August 2010.br /br /I still absolutely LOVE my Kindle Keyboard and use it almost every day. I have read dozens of books on it. I like the newer models, they have some neat features, but the experience of reading a book on them is no better or worse than on my 1-year-old Kindle Keyboard. Page turns are now smoother and faster on the newest Kindles, but the difference is not enough to make it worth the cost of upgrading, in my opinion.br /br /The touch-screen interface of the Kindle Touch is pretty neat. But, unlike my iPad, I only use my Kindle to read books, and reading books is just as nice on any of the current Kindle models. I don't consider the touch screen a must have feature, and I'm normally obsessed with having the latest version of every tech product I own.br /br /For that reason, I think the cheapest Kindle is an excellent choice.Read more\"],\n",

I have an iPad and a Kindle DX, but I guess someone heard my complaints of them being too heavy and difficult to do extended-reading on. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love my iPad and DX, but this new generation of Kindle is perfect for reading outside and for long periods of time. The iPad gets completely washed out in sunlight and often irritates my eyes staring at it for more than a couple of hours. The DX was my go-to device for those extended/outdoor reading periods, but now I have a new friend for reading novels. Instead of a replacement, this one seems more like a companion to the other devices and is a different class. The iPad works great for web browsing, shopping, productivity, games, etc while the Kindle falls short in those areas. The Kindle works great for reading novels, where the iPad falls short. For those that love to do extended-reading of magazines, newspapers, research articles, etc, I find that the DX is the go-to device.br /br /Without a doubt, the size and weight of the new kindle is the biggest draw for me. It's smaller than the last edition by a significant margin. I've played around with the Kindle 2 and was impressed, but now looking at the size of the new Kindle, I'm blown away. It's the absolute perfect size. Smaller would be unmanageable and larger wouldn't feel nearly as good. This is a device that you can hold up, read, and just forget that it's there. Compared to other e-readers I've tried, it's much smaller and much lighter.br /br /One of my biggest complaints about the previous generation Kindles and the DX is the speed.

I love the Kindle Keyboard as my clumsy old hands tremble too much to type on a touch screen. For me, newer is just more frustrating. However, new Keyboard Kindles are scarce on the ground, so I got a reconditioned one. I noticed on my account page that Amazon recognized my new Kindle as soon as I bought it. When it arrived, however, it was not registered to me and it claimed it could not connect to my home WiFi. So I called my internet provider. I waded through that companys automated menu beginning with press 1 for English. That irritates me as I think English should be the default language in this country. But pressing on, I provided my 9 digit phone number, my 10 digit account number, my 9 digit zip code, my address, my 8 digit birthday, and the name of my favorite pet, my first car and my oldest nephew. Then I listened to an automated menu that had a 9 item selection none of which exactly fitted the problem I was having. After all this, I was asked if I would provide feedback after the call. I know this company and I was sure I would have comments to make, so I pressed 1 for yes. Then instead of finally letting me speak to a person, the automated voice directed me back through the forest of numbers I had already provided. Patiently I retyped all I had already typed. This time I was cannier. I refused the opportunity to give feedback and was finally connected to a person a person with a strong foreign accent and a bad phone connection. Didnt I press 1 for English After struggling for several minutes I begged for a supervisor as I could not understand the English spoken by this person. I was eventually routed to three other people with a hold time between each new connection as each person I spoke to did not handle my problem. I asked for phone numbers every time so I could reconnect if my call was disconnected accidentally. Finally I found a person who could help and did indeed get a connection established between my Kindle and my WiFi. I again asked for a telephone number in case I had further problems. Im sorry. I do not have a phone number that you can call to connect directly to me. Well, I should have known. I had been on the phone for 50 minutes.Then my Kindle would not download my archived items. So I contacted Amazons Help Line. I got an American in the first minute. I did not have to press anything I explained my problem. The Amazon American fiddled with a few buttons on his end and my Kindle began working correctly. I was on the phone for 4 minutes.'],\n",

       "  'reviews': [\"I researched the purchase of a Kindle for a long time. I couldn't decide whether or not it was worth buying a dedicated e-reader. Boy am I glad I made this purchase. The downside to Amazon's online selling of Kindle 3 is that the customers don't get to see it in person. It is much better in person. This may sound stupid, but when I got my new Kindle, I thought there was a stuck-on overlay on the screen containing a diagram of the unit's buttons, etc. I actually tried to peel it off. Doh! The e-ink on this unit is THAT good. I didn't realize that I was staring at the actual display. I also didn't realize that no power is required until the display changes. (thus the great battery life) I do a lot of reading, but was facing the prospect of reading less or buying large type books because of my variable and deteriorating eyesight. The new Kindle has been a godsend. Now, I can decide the size of type I need depending on my level of fatigue among other things. The weight and ergonomics are very good. For someone, like me, with neuropathy in his hands, it is extremely easy to manage and enjoyable to own. To me, it is easier to read than print books. The ease of navigation is great as is the speed. The battery life, so far, has been extraordinary. It easily connected to our home Wi-Fi, which by design does not broadcast an SSID. It downloads books so fast that I almost thought they were not completely received. I did not buy the 3G version because of the price difference and the fact that there is no coverage where I live. If you are not constantly traveling, I don't see the need to spend the extra bucks, but that is a matter of personal choice. For those who have no Wi-Fi at home, remember that you can always download the material to your computer and transfer it via USB.Read more\"],\n",

Essentially. the same as the previous Kindle Paperwhite but with a fantastic upgraded (300 dpi) screen, more memory and storage it's a terrific reading device. This review aims to describe both this product, and compare it with the other Kindle devices available to help you choose the best one for you.Before I start, Ive noticed several complains about Kindle not supporting the ePub format used by Canadian public libraries. Dont be put off, theres a solution in the Frequently Asked Questions section below.This review is broken up into sections so you can skip the less interesting bits. If youre in a hurry Ive included a summary at the start, and a Frequently Asked Questions section at the end.Summary - What can you do with it-----------------------------------------* Read a book. It can store 1,000s of books - take an entire library away with you on holiday.* Buy a book. You can browse the Amazon kindle store, and buy books over a WIFI connection* Borrow a book. Using the Kindle Owners Library you can borrow one of 60,000 books (if you have Amazon Prime Membership)* Share your books. Using Amazon Family Library to link two Amazon accounts and four children and share your books with the entire family* Highlight a section. Using the touch screen, you can highlight a particulary interesting few lines. If several people highlight the same section, that's also indicated.* Record a bookmark. To come back to it later* Read a book on your Kindle, continue on your smartphone or tablet computer, and it will jump to your last known position* Look up a word, and record them in the vocabulary builder* Track a characters appearance throughout a book using the X Ray feature.* Read for weeks without needing to recharge - typically 4-6 weeks* Share you books (Multiple Kindles on the same account, or family sharing)* Access every book you've ever owned on the cloud - available for download within seconds over WIFI or 3G..What Devices are available--------------------------------As of July 2015, Amazon have the following Kindle devices on sale:-1. Kindle 6 (around CDN 79)2. Kindle Paperwhite 6th Generation (212 dpi - launched October 2013) - around CDN 1292. New Kindle Paperwhite 7th Gen (300 dpi - launched July 2015) - around CDN 139-2093. Kindle Voyger - around US 219-289 (Doesnt seem to be on sale in Amazon Canada)4. Kindle Fire - 6 or 7 colour tablet computers at around CDN 300-400So you're faced with a few devices, plus additional options. Which to buy Here's a quick summary in order of cost.*** The entry level Kindle ***An entry level black and white (e-ink) book reader, it has a 6 inch touch screen with enough storage to hold thousands of books, and a battery which should last around 4 weeks.A terrific device to read books, and a worthy contender. For the technically minded, it has a 1Ghz processor and 4Gb of memory with an E-ink display. Essentially this means it's (a) Black and White (b) Fantastic to read even in bright sunlight (c) Requires very little power - hence the battery lasts for weeks instead of hours.*** New Kindle Paperwhite ***Launched in 2015, this is really an upgrade adding a super-sharp display with 300 pixels per inch - the same as the top of the range Voyage. The high resolution screen does provide a crisp text which is pleasing to the eye, but battery life is reduced from 8 weeks of the original Paperwhite to 6 weeks - but still a very long time.Compared to the existing (2013) Paperwhite it also includes double the memory which means its faster and slicker than before, and a new Bookerly font plus better presentation of fonts on screen.If you have an existing Paperwhite its probably not worth upgrading. However, if you own a prior device, youll notice the huge leap in screen quality, contrast and performance.*** The Voyage ***Far more expensive that Paperwhite, this is thinner and 26g lighter. It has more of a quality feel with the screen flush with the e-reader body which makes it look more like a tablet, and keeps dirt from getting caught in the edges. The back has a soft touch plastic finish which feels lovely in the hand, and it has new Page Press buttons on the side to turn the pages. When the buttons are pressed theres a gentle vibration for feedback (nice touch). It has 4Gb of storage (same as the Paperwhite), and a similar battery which should last around 6 weeks on a single charge.Although it has the same sharp (300 dpi) screen as the Paperwhite, the backlight includes an ambient light sensor so it automatically adjusts to different lighting conditions. This means if you read it the dark it will automatically adjust the brightness so it doesnt look too bright. In addition, youll find when you switch off the room light your eyes naturally become accustomed to the darkness. To compensate, the Voyage automatically softens the light slightly. A lovely example of attention to detail in this premium device.*** Kindle Fire Tablet Computer ***The Kindle Fire range is a very different beast to the rest of the Kindle range. Similar to the Apple iPad mini, it has a high resolution screen, a fast processor and lots of memory with a colour screen and a much shorter battery life - hours rather than weeks. Although you can read books on a Fire using the Amazon Kindle App, youll find the Kindle with its sharp black and white screen far more like reading a physical book. Youll find it produces less eye strain, and whereas a tablet computer is better suited to surfing the web, watching videos and reading eMails, the Kindle is a dedicated book reader device.Unlike a Kindle, the Fire produces light at the blue end of the spectrum which means it may make it harder for you to sleep. The Paperwhite and Voyage also ave the advantage of a soft white back-light which is far more suited to reading in bed, and it wont for example, wake your partner if reading in the dark.Finally, unlike the rest of the Kindle range, the Fire is almost useless in bright sunlight so while its fine for everyday use, its less useful on holiday. The Kindle range of devices are perfect to take away on holiday as they can carry thousands of books, and are a pleasure to read even in bright sunlight.What other options do I have----------------------------------Having decided upon the model (Kindle, Paperwhite, Voyage or Fire), the next decision is around:-* Special Offers - ie. adverts* 3G or WIFI connectionPersonally I have no issue with adverts on a Kindle. They only appear on screen when the screen saver is on, and are not at all distracting.The 3G option is a more difficult question. This effectively means you can use your kindle to buy or download books over-the-air instead of at home or near a WIFI hotspot. Personally I went for the WIFI model as the saving is considerable, but its a personal choice. Of course if you wont have WIFI at home, then youll need the 3G option.One point worth mentioning however, is if you have a modern smartphone, you can always create a Personal Hotspot or local WIFI signal that your Kindle (or indeed any other WIFI device) can connect to. Got to Settings Personal Hotspot on your mobile to set one up, and you can connect your WIFI only Kindle while youre out and about.Conclusion-------------If you love books but your on a budget, the original Kindle with WIFI and special offers is a great option. Youll still be able to carry thousands of book around with you, but youll lose out on the soft white back-light and super crisp display of the Papwerwhite.The Kindle Paperwhite is your next best option and is a terrific device for reading with a superb 300 dpi super-sharp screen. Finally, theres the top of the range Voyage with the page press buttons and ambient light sensor which automatically adjusts the brightness.If youre in the market for a Tablet Computer then the Kindle Fire range is worth considering, but youll get a better book reading experience on the Kindle. Myself I have both a Paperwhite and an iPad Air 2. I was skeptical at first, but the Kindle is a perfect device for reading with one hand (on the train), and the back-light and long battery life a huge bonus.Frequently Asked Questions---------------------------------Q: What file format will a Kindle readA: Kindle Format 8 (AZW3), Kindle (AZW), TXT, PDF, unprotected MOBI, PRC natively in addition to HTML, DOC, DOCX, JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP through conversionQ: What It doesnt support EPUB formatA: No - but you can convert your EPUB books using a freely available program called Calibre. Simple search for You Tube um0teoAR6zw and youll see a video explaining how to do this. Simples.Q: If I lose my Kindle, do I lose my books as wellA: No. All books are available on your Amazon account to download on a new device.Q: Can I save my place in the bookA: Yes. It will automatically save your place, and if you resume on other device it will prompt you to jump to that position.Q: I often need reading glasses - can I adjust the font sizeA: Yes. Theres a range of fonts, and sizes to suit all tastesQ: Can I share books with my partner or childrenA: Yes. You can now share your books using Amazon Family Library to link two Amazon accounts and four children and share your books with the entire familyQ. Can I use a Kindle to read in bedA. Yes. But only on the Paperwhite and Voyage models. Its a pleasure to read in the dark with a soft white light. For the base Kindle model youll need the light onQ. Are there any free books availableA. Yes! Over 40,000 classic titles are available for free (out of copyright), and they can be legally downloaded. If you have a Amazon Prime membership you can also borrow a book from the Kindle Owners Library which includes around 60,000 books.Q: How long does the battery lastA: Depending upon model, you should get between 4 and 6 weeks between charges on around 30 minutes of reading per day. Ive certainly found Ive gone for weeks without charging the deviceQ: How long does it take to chargeA: From absolutely flat, around 4 hoursQ: How many books will the Kindle holdA: Literally thousands. You can also download every book youve ever owned from your Amazon account - so the list is quite literally unlimited.Q: Do I need anything elseA: Youll need a smartphone charger or laptop with a USB socket as the Kindle range doesnt come with a charger (but the Fire does). Amazon also offer an additional charger to buy if you need it. Some people also buy a cover, but I think this is not really needed. It adds to the weight, and is not really needed. It will protect your Kindle from a drop however, and protect the screen if its left knocking around in a bag.\"], 'keywords': ['fantastic upgraded 300', 'bmp conversionq doesnt', 'kindle', 'device best', 'book kindle', 'superb', 'reading', 'reading device best', 'superb reading', 'papwerwhite', 'conversionq', 'device']}\n",

I own an iPad, an iPhone, and have owned a Windows-based phone in the past that I used as an ereader.My overall impression of the device is good.The good:I'd honestly rather read linear (read from page one to the end, one page at a time) fiction from it than a book, because I can't always get comfortable with a book. Hardcovers are sometimes a bit heavy, and paperbacks don't always lie open easily. The Kindle is incredibly light and thin. I can hold it in one hand easily. The page turn buttons are conveniently located. Page-turns aren't instant, but they're probably quicker than turning a physical page in a printed book (there are just a lot more page-turns unless you choose a small font). The contrast is better than other ereaders I've seen. There is zero eye strain in good light. My eyesight isn't the greatest and I like being able to increase the font size and read without glasses. I love being able to browse the Kindle store and read samples before deciding to purchase. The experimental browser is surprisingly usable, but isn't great. It is useful for browsing wikipedia and blogs. The biggest drawback to the browser is the awkward pointer navigation, using the 5-way pad. It syncs your furthest read page over the internet so you can pick up where you left off using your iPhone or iPad.The so-so:The kindle store could use more categories and sorting options. You can't sort by top rated, and there is no category for alternate histories, for example. Finding a very-specific type of fiction relies on keyword searches, which don't do a great job. The wifi sometimes doesn't connect before it times-out.Read more\"], 'keywords': ['novels good', 'finish', 'kindle ink reader', 'start finish', 'kindle', 'physical', 'worth', 'deciding purchase experimental', 'quicker turning physical', 'novels', 'worth money', 'honestly']}\n",

The iPad gets completely washed out in sunlight and often irritates my eyes staring at it for more than a couple of hours.

The iPad works great for web browsing, shopping, productivity, games, etc while the Kindle falls short in those areas. The Kindle works great for reading novels, where the iPad falls short. For those that love to do extended-reading of magazines, newspapers, research articles, etc, I find that the DX is the go-to device.Without a doubt, the size and weight of the new kindle is the biggest draw for me. It's smaller than the last edition by a significant margin. I've played around with the Kindle 2 and was impressed, but now looking at the size of the new Kindle, I'm blown away. It's the absolute perfect size. Smaller would be unmanageable and larger wouldn't feel nearly as good. This is a device that you can hold up, read, and just forget that it's there.

However, new Keyboard Kindles are scarce on the ground, so I got a reconditioned one. I noticed on my account page that Amazon recognized my new Kindle as soon as I bought it. When it arrived, however, it was not registered to me and it claimed it could not connect to my home WiFi. So I called my internet provider. I waded through that companys automated menu beginning with press 1 for English. That irritates me as I think English should be the default language in this country. But pressing on, I provided my 9 digit phone number, my 10 digit account number, my 9 digit zip code, my address, my 8 digit birthday, and the name of my favorite pet, my first car and my oldest nephew. Then I listened to an automated menu that had a 9 item selection none of which exactly fitted the problem I was having. After all this, I was asked if I would provide feedback after the call. I know this company and I was sure I would have comments to make, so I pressed 1 for yes. Then instead of finally letting me speak to a person, the automated voice directed me back through the forest of numbers I had already provided. Patiently I retyped all I had already typed. This time I was cannier. I refused the opportunity to give feedback and was finally connected to a person a person with a strong foreign accent and a bad phone connection. Didnt I press 1 for English After struggling for several minutes I begged for a supervisor as I could not understand the English spoken by this person. I was eventually routed to three other people with a hold time between each new connection as each person I spoke to did not handle my problem. I asked for phone numbers every time so I could reconnect if my call was disconnected accidentally. Finally I found a person who could help and did indeed get a connection established between my Kindle and my WiFi. I again asked for a telephone number in case I had further problems. Im sorry. I do not have a phone number that you can call to connect directly to me. Well, I should have known. I had been on the phone for 50 minutes.Then my Kindle would not download my archived items. So I contacted Amazons Help Line. I got an American in the first minute. I did not have to press anything I explained my problem.

I couldn't decide whether or not it was worth buying a dedicated e-reader. Boy am I glad I made this purchase. The downside to Amazon's online selling of Kindle 3 is that the customers don't get to see it in person. It is much better in person. This may sound stupid, but when I got my new Kindle, I thought there was a stuck-on overlay on the screen containing a diagram of the unit's buttons, etc. I actually tried to peel it off. Doh! The e-ink on this unit is THAT good. I didn't realize that I was staring at the actual display. I also didn't realize that no power is required until the display changes. (thus the great battery life) I do a lot of reading, but was facing the prospect of reading less or buying large type books because of my variable and deteriorating eyesight. The new Kindle has been a godsend. Now, I can decide the size of type I need depending on my level of fatigue among other things. The weight and ergonomics are very good. For someone, like me, with neuropathy in his hands, it is extremely easy to manage and enjoyable to own. To me, it is easier to read than print books. The ease of navigation is great as is the speed. The battery life, so far, has been extraordinary. It easily connected to our home Wi-Fi, which by design does not broadcast an SSID. It downloads books so fast that I almost thought they were not completely received. I did not buy the 3G version because of the price difference and the fact that there is no coverage where I live. If you are not constantly traveling, I don't see the need to spend the extra bucks, but that is a matter of personal choice.
