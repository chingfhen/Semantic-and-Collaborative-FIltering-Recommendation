       " 'Review': ['The Journey Home is the story of Maggie and Annie, two young sisters who leave the filthy streets of New York to live with an adopted family in Kansas. The story is short and sweet, very reminiscent of Little House on the Prairie.The plot was cute, but it felt rushed. I wanted to learn more about the characters and I wanted their personalities to build more. I also felt, that this being a book for younger children, the talks of religion, such as the Catholics vs. Protestants may be lost on younger readers. Even I had a hard time keeping up with it.Overall, this story is an easy read that makes you smile in the end. If you are one who has loved books such as Little House on the Prairie, this book is definitely for you. Maggie is very much like the headstrong Laura. Similar to that series, the characters learn a very important lesson in the end.',\n",

But since Maggie is determined to keep them together — she promised her mother — placing them is difficult. Once they find a home with the Russell family in Kansas, they have problems settling in. While this is a moving and, at times, bittersweet, story, it does not tell the entire story of the Orphan Trains. Not all of the children found kind, loving families. Some were treated much like slave labor, while others may have suffered from abuse. Siblings  separated, and sometimes spend a lifetime looking for one another.',\n",

Three elements made this one of the best books I have ever read: -- The spiritual and natural aspect of how Crazy Horse and his people read the signs gave to the Universe. I will always hold a copy of this book to hope to understand the ways of them. The language is amazing.-- The history of how the expansion of settlers over the West was met by the tribes. And the political ramifications of the chiefs who looked for benefits for themselves and their groups while selling out the others. Much like today.-- Finally, the beauty of the storytelling that Sandoz delivers via interviews, records and folklore to depict the selfless man who led and cared for thousands. Highly recommended!', 'This is actually a significant book in a number of ways because on some topics it is the closest thing we have to original source material on the Sioux viewpoint of the wars. I\\'d recommend reading the into which spells out some of the books strengths and deficiencies but essentially it is as though a verbal history had been turned to print. Thus it is not short of opinion some of which is not objective nevertheless this author was able to interview and collect materials from people much closer to events such the Little Big Horn battle (Custer) than anyone living today. It\\'s not very kind to Red Cloud or Indians who had accepted the treaties (called fort loafers) but this might reflect the opinion of those still bitter at the outright theft of the Black Hills. It\\'s really ironic that they have carved up a mountain to make a tourist attraction dedicated to Crazy Horse as it\\'s exactly the kind of thing he would have fought violently to prevent.Given all the materials written from the side of the white combatants this book is also important because it spells out the void that exist(s) between them and the Sioux. I think it\\'s pretty widely accepted nowadays that men like Crazy Horse were understandably ambivalent to the agencies and reservations.Perhaps most importantly it give you an idea of how Crazy Horse was remembered by people who knew him or had tribal and family connections to him. You have to remember that although this book was written several decades ago it reads more like a contemporary work. This addition has added footnotes and other things that were not there in the previous editions but other than that this book reads more like something in the modern era than the racist undertones present in so many works written in the past.This book has some significance historically in my opinion as I\\'ve said but even if you are not an historian it reads well and like a story told around the campfire or lodge. It is not a highly technical or overly stodgy work in it\\'s methodology so on that alone it\\'s a worthy discussion item for a classroom. Often in my experience college freshmen have absolutely not clue about these things let along why some might object to the use of \"Fighting Sioux\" for the name of a sports team. This is one of those books that might help bridge that gulf.As I said there is still a space filled with misunderstanding between whites and Indians in this country.', 'So much has been written about Crazy Horse, but none with the provenance of this book. Ms. Sandoz grew up near the Sioux who knew Crazy Horse or whose relatives knew him. As a result, her book is generally recognized as the closest to the truth about Crazy Horse as we can get.The author uses the voice of an omniscient Native American narrator to tell the story. Please note that the narrator tells the story as many Native Americans would. The pace is slow, Native American descriptors are used (e.g., \"the moon of cherries black\") followed by the white interpretation, and descriptions of persons, villages, and environments are quite detailed. I found this method of telling the story to be perfect for enveloping the reader in the Native Americans\\' world and for clearly communicating how very differently they and the whites perceived nature, family, honor, and truth. Truly enlightening.', \"After commencing an in-depth study of Native American Tribes on the eastern seaboard and reading west, I crossed paths with the Lakotah Sioux and Crazy Horse in a hardcover book by Mari Sandoz, 'Crazy Horse: The Strange Man of the Oglalas.' Although the armchair journey ended here, I continued studying the Sioux.Sensed in words just so, Sandoz illumined the shadow side of Crazy Horse. In this specific lifetime, he participated significantly in the defeat of Custer in the Battle of the Little Big Horn in 1876. A legendary warrior, he fought many battles. However, I strongly suspect that the battle of the heart was his biggest battle. Intrigued by the notion that a man could so love a woman, even after she married another, I wondered: If they were alive today, what kind of people would they be, what kind of events would they attract, and would they attract each other?Was I inspired?You bet!Thirty-three books later, I completed the writing of a contemporary romance novel based on the personalities of Crazy Horse & Black Buffalo woman, foreshadowing the storyline on poignant nightdreams about both of them.Set in the Black Hills, no internet, no emails, but actual phone conversations & letters engaging SD COC’s, the Pine Ridge Reservation, Ruth Ziolkowski, co-founder of the Crazy Horse Monument, and Deadwood’s Historic Saloon #10.

Ever since I have rated this book, I always end up asking myself that, have I rated it with something it deserved or was it just out of sympathy (some call it pity vote)?Reading other reviews (although most people just rate it and proceed) posed me with many other questions and also gave me idea of what people generally think about her and her diary.So I’m going to start with- to review or even rate this  diary?Yes it is a diary not a book. And aren’t diary meant to be something personal? Yes they are, but it was Anne's wish to get her diary published and she even went on to fictionalize the diary by changing names.When I started this book I knew how it would end and who doesn’t! I had the least of the expectation, knowing that she was 13 years old but she just surprised me by the outlook she carried of life. She thought and wrote over few such things that didn’t occur to my mind until I read it but have applied throughout my life. She at times made me laugh, at times made me feel sad. If she felt something, her writing definitely made me experience it and thus she overcame my expectation by large margin.I have read in lot of review that her thoughts were way ahead of her age. Of course they were, difficult conditions make you mature and responsible, but there were also other people living under the same roof and in same condition, the suffering had even effect on them. I remember the letter exchange between two sisters, at that point after reading Margot’s letter, for the first time I realised Anne was still child among them.Some say she could visualize herself and her thoughts and actions from different perspective and thus realise her fault.The thing with diary is that it is a lopsided view of the events. She would write her thoughts and what she wrote of others were her interpretation of them.....I have it in my mind but can’t put it in words and why should I! Does it matter what kind of girl was she? 'NO’ from me. Last thing that occur to me is that .I liked it, it couldn’t get any better. I mean they were in hiding for their life in a same house for two years without even opening the window; they were not solving murder mystery. I remember that when I was halfway through the book, I would every now and then turn to the last diary entry and count the days that remained. I felt very sad and depressed and it would have been the last thing to occur to me that it was uninteresting; I was just taken by her wish to see the outside world again, feel the fresh wind and to go to school, but... This is not a book to enjoy much; we read it to gain the insight of hardships that people had to go through during this holocaust. Through this book she give us . No one has ever benefitted from war; all it gives is pain and misery.All this being said there is nothing to review the book, but accept it as written account of the vices of the war.The  that seemed to have been slapped across my face was: Would this book have meant the same if Anne had survived the holocaust and lived to become old? Would it have been famous as it is now? and no one can bring her back.\", 'I confess to feeling slightly voyeuristic while reading this. It was constantly in the back of my mind that this was no ordinary novel, or even a true-to-life account. This was someone’s diary. Every page written in confidence, each word revealing the thoughts closest to the heart of this young girl. As a journal-keeper myself, I sometimes find myself wondering, “What if someone else were to read this?” which causes me to wonder how much to filter my words. But then, isn’t the purpose of a diary or journal just the opposite? To record one’s honest and unfiltered thoughts? While reading Anne Frank – The Diary of a Young Girl I do not get the sense that there is any such ‘filtering’ going on. From the ages of 12-15 Anne lived an extraordinary life, and quickly grew far beyond her years in her understanding and handling of a horrendous situation.There are surprises in this book. No matter how broad or limited your understanding of the world events that threw Anne and her family into a life in hiding, I had – before reading this – held the general assumption that, “Well, it was wartime. They were in hiding for their lives. They must have been miserable all the time. Who could possibly find anything good or redeeming in the confines of such a life?” In hindsight, of course, I have had to reconsider. I found bits of beauty, kindness, and even humour popping up in the most unexpected places. And why shouldn’t I? Aren’t our lives much the same? Oh – we’re not dodging bombs and trying to sleep to the sound of gunfire (at least not in Canada). But we, each of us, are often faced with some sort of tragedy or travesty. Sometimes we may have an entire ‘bad year’, or longer. And yet, doesn’t the buoyancy of the human spirit always shine through? It is really tough work to be miserable 24 hours a day. No matter how difficult or challenged our day-to-day life, we all have those little pockets of joy that arise, and sometimes it is those tiny occurrences that make the rest of it bearable.On a personal level, I found myself comparing Anne’s childhood to that of my parents. After all, she was only a year younger than my Mom and Dad. I think back to stories they’ve told from their teen years, and it boggles the mind to think that at the exact moment my Dad and his brothers were tipping a cow, Anne was in hiding on the other side of the world. At a time when my mother was discovering make-up, Anne was realizing that life would never again be so youthful, so joyous and carefree as before the war. A generation was losing its innocence, but in very different ways.I would recommend Anne Frank – The Diary of a Young Girl to absolutely everyone, for I believe that it holds some truth or enlightenment for everyone. I do not own this copy – it was borrowed from my daughter’s school library. She will be reading it next. She is 10. And you can bet that before long I will purchase my own copy, for I will be reading it again someday soon.', 'My intention of writing a review for this book is to tell all the negative reviewers to SHUT UP! I am all for everyone\\'s right to express their opinion but I read a few of the \\'1 star\\' reviews and I was shocked to read what a few people had to say about this book. Before making an opinion I suggest people to keep a few things in mind:1. This is someone\\'s DIARY not a book meant to entertain people. If you think it was boring then answer me, how many interesting things can you possibly do locked up in a place for 3 years??2. For those who comment on the writing-This is a 14year old\\'s diary!! She didn\\'t write it with the intention of winning the pulitzer.3.For those who commented on her ideologies or how nazism is portrayed. Hello!! She was 14!!! And maybe..just maybe its justified to think the way she does considering she LIVED it unlike so many of us who get to sit back on our comfortable sofas and critically analyze every XYZ thing in the world.I believe no one has the right to \\'review\\' much less criticize a written document of a 14 year old\\'s life who made it through the worst of circumstances and through difficulties we cannot even imagine to live through.Its a pity some people think the way they do.EDIT 27th Sep, 2013:I never imagined I would garner so many likes for this review. This only means that a lot of people are emotional about this book and take negative reviews as a personal insult. I wrote this review in a very emotionally charged mind frame. A year later, now that I am older, wiser and more mature, I realise I could have used fewer exclamation marks. :PEDIT 24th Sep, 2020: It\\'s been 8 years since I wrote this! I am definitely, older, wiser and more mature. And so, I would like to point out, that I do regret the explosive \"SHUT UP\" in my review, no scratch that, in my \"rant\". I guess such is life when you are young- angry & angsty. It\\'s amazing though that despite the angry tonality, there is so much love pouring in the comments section! Thanks y\\'all. I shall continue my attempt to grow wiser as I grow older. PS: Time for a re-read?', \"If only Anne Frank's diary was the figment of someone's imagination. If it meant that this spirited, intelligent and articulate girl hadn't died along with so many others in Belsen concentration camp, and that the holocaust had never happened, that would be a wonderful thing, but it did happen, and that makes the reading of this diary even more heartbreaking.For a 13 year old girl, Anne was so articulate - the way she expresses her thoughts and feelings about herself and others is remarkable. She's able to analyse herself in a particularly honest way, her abilities, failures, weaknesses.As Jews in Nazi occupied Holland, Anne and her parents and sister Margot, had to flee their home in Amsterdam to escape capture. From 1942 - 1944 they occupy rooms in an old office building, which they call 'The Secret Annexe'. Anne's diary details daily life within the confines of their safe house. They share the rooms with another couple and their teenage son and also with a former dentist. As can be expected, there were many disagreements, living in such close proximity to others, and even within their own families. Just a few of the office staff knew about The Secret Annexe, and these are the people who kept them supplied with food, but given the fact that everything was rationed due to the war, things became a bit fraught at times. The alternative however, didn't bear thinking about.In August 1944, Anne's diary suddenly becomes silent. No more words will be written in its pages. Someone had betrayed them to the Nazis and they were arrested and transported to various concentration camps. The diary was left behind and was found by the office cleaner. After being interned in two concentration camps, Anne and her sister Margot were finally sent to Bergen-Belsen where they both died - Anne was just 15 years old. Only Otto Frank (the girls' father) survived, and the diary was returned to him.This is one of those books where a silence descends on finishing it. How do you write a review? How do you do it justice? I honestly don't know. All I can think is, what a great contribution Anne would have made to an ugly world if she'd lived, her ambition was to be a writer, and yet, even in death, she HAS made a contribution by allowing us to share those two years in hiding with her, and giving us a chance to see what a beautiful soul she was. Feel so sad right now.\", \"I'm not sure if I can review this book properly. I started a few times before, but, it is just too difficult...I really wish I had skipped the Afterward section and read it sometime after. I don't recall being this sad after reading a book...From the very start, I found the style of writing to be very captivating, which could be hugely attributed to the fact that everything is completely genuine. As this was never intended to be shared with others, Anne does not hold back when it comes to confiding all her feelings, experiences and expectations in her ever trustworthy journal - Kitty. In my opinion, one of the key ways this book can help all readers is by enhancing everyone's ability to empathize, not just with a teenager. Anne's experiences shine a special light on how much children suffer, due to them not being able to freely communicate or confide in others. One might say that it's just how it is with teenagers, and they'll grow out of it, but Anne's own statements contradict that - at least to an extent. When she revisits some of her earlier entries, though she regrets the fact that she feels much anger toward her mother, she never recovers completely, or finds it possible to completely forgive her. She still holds some contempt for not been able to make herself herd by her mother.It's heartbreaking to see how she suffered, when she dreamt of her friends and grandmother, and the way she kept it all together in the midst of all other difficulties. Even an adult would have had a hard time under similar circumstances. But for a child... and thousands of others who went through similar devastations...If I didn't say something of some of the happy memories, it will be unfair to the book. Because, even when you take away the fact that everything in this book is genuine, the style of writing - especially for an 13 year old girl - is beyond amazing. The first half of the books is going to keep you laughing, for Anne relates the day-to-day events in such an amusing way. Most readers will find the series of events to be an emotional rollercoaster. It's amazing how well she manages to record everything, relating them to people, time of day, her own feelings and many more. Yes, she would've been an amazing writer. In fact, she already has become one. How cruel it is that the hopes and dreams of millions get destroyed because of the thoughtless actions of a few.All I can hope is that she kept the hope kindled till the end and never gave up.\"], 'Genre': ['Classics', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Biography', 'Autobiography', 'Memoir', 'Historical', 'World War II', 'Holocaust', 'Biography', 'Autobiography', 'War', 'War', 'World War II'], 'Summary': ['Es éste un estremecedor testimonio escrito por una niña que va camino a la adolescencia, un documento desgarrador que da cuenta de la lucha de una colectividad humana contra la persecución implacable y el odio racial, encarnados en los agentes de las S.

I have digitized her first public appearance and if you have never heard her speak or seen her, it is an experience you won\\'t want to miss.

Thank you for your support and sharing her message. \"The heart is only so big, so I don\\'t hate.... To hate is to let Hitler win.\"', \"It is beautifully written and a remarkable story. One might be inclined to discount it, expecting a tragic misery memoir. But this story is in the vein of Victor Frankl; it's a story about how we survive, about how family and memory can lend individuals in the direst of circumstances the most incredible strength. Rena Kornreich was among the first transport of women to Auschwitz and she is also one of the few women from that first transport who survived to see the camp liberated. Sometimes the story is so remarkable and the writing so fluid and captivating that it reads like fiction. But the story is all too true, and through Rena's story we get a panoramic view of what it was like for the women victims and survivors of Nazi Germany and Auschwitz. I HIGHLY recommend, and I'm not usually a fan of memoir.\", \"I first read this book back in 2015 and this story has continued to stay with me all throughout these years and like so many other holocaust stories i always have to come back for a reminder. Rena's story is a very interesting one as she is on the first transport to Auschwitz with just under a 1,000 other women where she would be there right up until the end when the war ended. Rena's story has a reminder of hope and humanity of those that were stuck in this horrendous time in human history and it's tremendously commendable. Rena along with her sister who eventually joined her did everything in her power to stay out of the line of sight of being killed in the camp and never gave up hope even in the most traumatic of circumstances. I am so glad that i was able to read and revisit this story and will again in the future because it really does need to be read and talked about. Thank you Rena for telling your story and leaving it in book form for everyone that comes next to read it. \", 'Rena Kornreich was 19 years old when the Nazis swept into Poland. She recounts her experiences under the brutal Nazi occupation of Poland, and her deportation, along with her younger sister Danka, in March 1942. to Auschwitz, where in harrowing detail she tells of the horrifying conditions there, and the perverse cruelty of the Nazis.She tells of her promise to stand by her sister to the end, and describes the gas chambers and the cruel experiments on Jewish girls and women by Mengele.She recounts the logic of Nazi genocide...how any consistent Nazi plan had to target Jewish women specifically as women., for they were the only ones who would be able to ensure the continuation of Jewish life.There is sound evidence that the odds for surviving the Holocaust were worse for Jewish women than Jewish men.[...]Rena tells how she and her sister survived against the odds, and the epilogue tells of the lives of those who survived, and their experiences after the war.', 'This book is a touching recount of the war in the eyes of two growing young women. Among the first 999 Jewish girls on the first transport brought into Auschwitz on March 26, 1942, was twenty-one year old Rena Kornreich-the seven hundred and sixteenth woman in that infamous death camp, Auschwitz. Two days later, she recognized her sister Danka among thousand other freshly shaved heads in Auschwitz where, together, they spent the next three years of their young lives as slaves to the Third Reich. From then on, she made a promise, to herself and to her parents [whom she will never see again], that she will survive this thing and return triumphant, with her sister, home. This story tells of the three painful years they spent in living hell, praying fervently that they would one day be liberated. Rena, being the elder sister, took great care of Danka during their captivity, time and time again giving up her meager portion of bread to get medicine when weak Danka was ill, and doing whatever it took to ensure a place for both her and her sister to be together during the many ‘selections’ and all these while holding on to her promise. Life in Auschwitz-Birkenau was hard; Rena had seen enough of war in occupied Poland, where she was from, to know a little of what to expect from the Nazis. Yet, she was still unable to fathom their cruelty. Rena quotes certain incidences which gave me goose bumps. There was once the kapos released dogs on a Jew who was too weak to carry on her task, and she died when the dogs bit her on her neck, still screaming all the way back to their block quarters. It was a scene that witnesses will never forget, and as I pictured that scene, it will stay etched in my mind forever. How can the Nazis enforce such cruelty? Don’t they have a conscience? Do they even have a heart? The conditions in the concentration camps were also horrible, what with no bunk beds, only shelves; three tiers high to make do as beds. The floor was basically covered in dirt and there was a sour smell of human odor. They were treated like non-living things, as if it is alright for them to suffer. Aren’t Jews humans too? The hard times that have passed may have been part of history but the memories will never fade. As I read this book, I cannot help reflecting on myself. How I would flinch at the slightest bit of dust and grumble should I not be happy about certain ideals in my life, and how I expect everything to be nothing short of perfection. I get upset when things do not go my way, and bothered when people reprimand me. Should I have been living in Rena’s shoes, I would have just given up on my sister, given up on myself. This book inspired me to go further, think deeper into my own life and reflect on how things have been going my way, yet still moaning that this and that has yet reached perfection. Though this blind chase of perfection is not a bad thing, I realized that sometimes you just have to take things the way they are, and live with it instead of trying to change things. Rena did not try to escape, nor did she constantly grumble about life. This gave herself, as well as her sister, the courage to move out of the darkness. For those who grumble constantly hold no hope for themselves, only fear in the deepest pits of their hearts. Only with hope, could Rena and her sister survive. I have learnt a lot from this novel. Much as I love reading about their account, I cannot help wishing that all those who lost their lives in Rena’s story could have lived their life differently, happily, less painfully. Life had been so unfair to them, and death, what I think must be the saddest thing in life, was in fact a form of liberation for them. Their short twisted lives would never end the way it was meant to be. I cannot help thinking: Hey some of them could have been doctors saving lives, famous lawyers ending trials, people who would do great things! And now they would never be able to do those things ever again.'], 'Genre': ['World War II', 'Holocaust', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Autobiography', 'Memoir', 'War', 'World War II', 'Biography', 'Historical', 'War', 'Biography Memoir', 'Biography', 'Autobiography'], 'Summary': ['Sent to Auschwitz on the first Jewish transport, Rena Kornreich survived the Nazi death camps for over three years.

This was before the mass of streaming sources we have today, before the internet, before, even, cable, before news was considered a corporate profit center. There were three national network news programs, on ABC, NBC and CBS. Each featured serious, strong newsmen reporting the biggest stories of the day, in an era before anchors were referred to as news . Walter Cronkite was prime among these. He was, arguably, the most trusted person in America, referred to, fondly, as “Uncle Walter.” One of the turning points in the widespread opposition to the Viet Nam War was when Cronkite made it clear on his national platform that the war was unwinnable and the USA should get out. One of the most moving moments in television history was when Cronkite struggled to maintain his composure when he learned, and In , Cronkite tells his life story, from roots in Kansas City and later Houston, through days as a sports announcer, from newspapers to radio to television. It is an interesting read from an American institution. He holds some rather progressive notions concerning war and peace, yet talks about how appalled he was at the clothing his daughter wore in the 1960’s. He is most entertaining when writing about his experiences as a reporter in Moscow, when telling about Mayor Daley and the 1968 convention, telling about Nixon, and the invasion of the newsroom by entertainment values. It is a pretty good and worthwhile read. But, surprisingly and sadly, given Cronkite’s importance in American culture, and his talent with words, I did not find it to be compelling read, which is what it should have been. But that’s the way it is.', '', \"A good autobiography on what is now an extinct breed: The great professional journalist. No longer will anyone in journalism have the reputation or credibility that Cronkite had during his prime. What replaces him these days cannot even compare. It is amazing to read how Cronkite saw the world, being a direct observer to some of the greatest events of the 20th century. Now, was Cronkite perfect...no. His commentary on Vietnam has been decried by several in the military and he made no secret of his political leaning (Democrat)...but in his reporting, most would agree, left and right, that he was a man who could be counted on to give you the straight story. It is unfortunate, given the pervasiveness of 24/7 media, that men like him don't appear to exist. Then again, reading Cronkite's work, he foresaw this...the dangers of 24/7 news outlets and how it would degrade the quality of journalism. It is a shame that it came to fruition. \", \"3/5 stars.This took me just about two months to finish, however, I still found it an interesting read. Books like these, written by large cultural figures, can be either super intriguing or very boring, but I felt that Cronkite's book was in between. It dragged on during certain chapters but was very lively during others. I didn't know much about Cronkite before I read this, so I certainly learned much about him during reading, but if I hadn't had this book in my house I don't think I would have necessarily reached out to read it. I do wish that I was able to get through this quicker but alas, some books are just much slower. Glad to finally be finished.\", 'For the most part I felt the author to be mildly to moderately cocky, and arrogant in his narrative. This is understandable to some degree considering the fact it\\'s an autobiography and the natural inclination is to portrays yourself the hero, but at times it was almost too much to bear. While there were some moments of humility and humor, more frequently I felt it took on a \"snobbish\" tone and too much of it was a recounting of major events in which he participated in, or people he rubbed shoulders with or enjoys an intimate relationship with, elitist things he\\'s been able to do etc etc. blah blah blah; BUT, hidden throughout the text at random points are really astute insights regarding politics, society, media news, television culture and other various issues I personally think of often, and I feel are of major relevance and importance today. Because of this, I am glad that I \"soldiered on\" and finished the book, resisting my urge to put it down at times. Prior to reading this book I was familiar with the name, but knew very little about him overall. It turns out that he was a pretty cool dude, as far as this history buff is concerned; having participated in or lived through many events that interest me. It\\'s just a shame that he thought so too; lol. Had his celebration of self been minimized a little I would probably have rated the book a 5/5, but I would still recommend the book to anyone interested in journalism, or the history of his time.
