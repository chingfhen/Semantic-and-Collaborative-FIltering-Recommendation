    "# ABOUT:\n",
    "- this code demontrates use of semanticSearch() and personalizedSearch()\n",
    "- background:\n",
    "    - in previous notebooks, i created semanticSearch() that first filters by genre then reranks by the CrossEncoder\n",
    "        - this is semantic because in both components Transformer models are used\n",
    "    - also, i created personalizedSearch() that, given the user_id returns book recommendations by a collaborative filtering model specifically AlternatingLeastSquares model\n",
    "- Motivation and advantages:\n",
    "    - Many book recommendation or search engines use lexical matching. \n",
    "        - Many relevant results may not be matched e.g  \"Fairies\" would not be matched to \"fantasy\" but they are semantically similar\n",
    "    - semanticSearch() pipeline is accurate yet efficient. \n",
    "        - Filtering by genres reduces the candidate pool drastically\n",
    "        - this allows CrossEncoder, a more powerful semantic similarity ranker to rerank a much smaller set of items\n",
    "    - our pipeline automatically extracts desired genres from users - which is useful because the list of genres is very large\n",
    "        - this makes search more seamless because the user does not need to scan and pick from a large list a genres\n",
    "    - personalizedSearch() makes relevant recommendation even without query, improving the user experience"

Dr Iannis practices medicine on the island of Cephalonia, accompanied by his daughter, Pelagia, to whom he imparts much of his healing art.

The officer in command of the Italian garrison is the cultured Captain Antonio Corelli, who responds to a Nazi greeting of “Heil Hitler” with his own “Heil Puccini”, and whose most precious possession is his mandolin.

Love is complicated enough in wartime, even when the lovers are on the same side.

       "  'Review': ['I couldn\\'t believe the disconnect between the reviews of this book and its content.  actually compares it to Bridget Jones, because, you know, all books written by women with a female protagonist in her 20s are the same. I thought this read like serious literary fiction. If a guy had written this book, he\\'d be called the next Salinger. If an older woman had written this book her name would be Abigail Thomas and it would be a memoir titled . To be fair, I picked this up at a thrift store while on vacation and given the chick-litty appearance of it I had low expectations. By the first few pages, I realized this was not going to be some silly dating stories. This was serious. Good serious.The only reason I\\'m not giving it 5 stars is because of the bizarre placement of the story titled \"The Best Possible Light.\" I got all excited to jump into the future with future-Jane. Then it turns out this is a story from the first-person point of view of a once-mentioned neighbor. That\\'d be fine if it ever happened again in the collection, but it doesn\\'t, which is weird. I trust that Bank is so smart she had a reason for it, but I searched for meta-clues in the text and couldn\\'t find any. Anyways, it didn\\'t matter. This book was serious, lovely, beautifully written, and funny and I hope someday it gets another shot with the critics.',\n",
       "   \"UPDATE: I learned that in Summer 2022, Melissa Bank passed away due to lung cancer. She remains a beautiful writer.It is a shame that Bank's prose is categorized as chick lit, because there is real weight and substance in her writing style. Perhaps she gets lumped into that fluffy genre because of her age and her contemporaries are cranking out pop fiction instead of literary fiction.Her characters proceed with humor, but it is not cheeky or plucky. If her characters were brought to life on tv, it would be a drama, not a comedy. Like my favorite short story collection of all time, , the protagonist, Jane Rosenal observes the world as a teenager through her early adulthood.The angst is palpable and more palatable than Holden Caulfield which makes it easy to come back to read again and again lost after resolving my own teen angst. She wrote a follow up and I hope she keeps writing more.\",\n",

       "   \"Based on the title, I thought that this novel would have some feminist themes, encouraging women to do things that normally men do, but instead this was a book about a series of romantic affairs, none of which were particularly engaging, memorable or unique. After realizing that the book was about relationships, at a minimum, I had hoped Ms. Bank would shed some new light on the woman's struggle to find a male partner in modern America...Instead, I found her writing to be caddy and her plot to be shallow and somewhat reflective of a soap-opera. The first chapter was enticing, but afterwards I found the protagonist's decisions and reflections to be vexingly childish. The main character does not seem to undergo any emotional transforamtion or intellectual growth. Furthermore, the novel lacked continuity, it seemed disorganized and left holes in the plot. Not a terribly satisfying read. Nonetheless I had to finish the book to find out who the protagonist ultimately ends up with. \",\n",
       "   'EXCERPT: I closed my eyes and tried to pretend I was in Nantucket. The house we\\'d rented every year there had a widow\\'s walk - a square porch on the roof, where the wives of sea captains were supposed to have watched for their husband\\'s ships. At night, we\\'d hear creaks and moans. Once I thought I heard footsteps pacing the widow\\'s walk. You could feel the ghosts in that house, scaring you in the best way. If there were any ghosts in this one, they weren\\'t moaning about husbands lost at sea but slamming doors over modern, trivial matters, such as not being allowed to go water skiing.ABOUT \\'THE GIRL\\'S GUIDE TO HUNTING AND FISHING\\': Generous-hearted and wickedly insightful, The Girls\\' Guide to Hunting and Fishing maps the progress of Jane Rosenal as she sets out on a personal and spirited expedition through the perilous terrain of sex, love, and relationships as well as the treacherous waters of the workplace. With an unforgettable comic touch, Bank skillfully teases out issues of the heart, puts a new spin on the mating dance, and captures in perfect pitch what it\\'s like to be a young woman coming of age in America today.MY THOUGHTS: I was actually looking for something else when I came across this, stuck behind some other books on my shelf. I remember reading this not long after it was first published, somewhere around 2000, twenty years ago now, so I thought that I would give it a reread and see how it has stood the test of time. And I am delighted to say that it has stood up well. Now I am not a chic lit lover. But I needed something light and easy to read, something where I wasn\\'t going to have to remember 93 characters and their relationships with one another, where I wasn\\'t going to have to remember a complicated plotline with numerous twists. The Girl\\'s Guide to Hunting and Fishing ticks all those boxes. The chapters are all separate stories, so it\\'s a good book for picking up and putting down again. Although I have to admit to reading it over a twenty four hour period, stretched out on the sofa watching the rain beating against the windows and catching a few zzzzzzzs every now and then. I liked Jane\\'s character. There\\'s a lot more depth to her than your average Chic Lit heroine. She\\'s kind, funny, smart and sassy, even if she doesn\\'t always have much confidence in herself. And I like her relationship with her family. And despite the light hearted tone, the author does deal with some serious issues, and does so with empathy. I had originally planned to read then discard this, but somewhere along the line, I changed my mind. It is now tucked back in its little hideyhole, ready for me to rediscover and hopefully enjoy again in a few more years. And for what it\\'s worth, IMHO The Girl\\'s Guide to Hunting and Fishing leaves Bridget Jone\\'s Diary for dead. ⭐⭐⭐.7THE AUTHOR: Melissa Bank (born in 1961 in Philadelphia) is an American author. She has published two books, The Girls\\' Guide to Hunting and Fishing, a volume of short stories, and The Wonder Spot,\" a novel, which have been translated into over thirty languages.

       "  'Review': [\"This is one of those books that defined me. I don't mean that I turned goth or vampire or whatever. No... it started me thinking.I was born and raised in the South. I didn't read anything else other than fantasy novels (like Dragonlance). I joined the Marines in 89 and while watching a movie about a teenage vampire it was mentioned that Dracula is 'good literature'. I went to the base library to check out Dracula and beside it on the shelf was this book. I took this one instead.The book was great. I loved it. The book engendered a question within me that never found any sunlight growing up a protestant in the Deep South. That queston, can something evil love? The values of the Southern protestant is one of black and white and there is no mixing, no grey, no overlap. By witnessing the drama of Lestat's journey, this manifestation of the Shadow declaring it's evil and it's good... I questioned this myself. It is a slippery slope to question everything. With no reading, history, or even exposure to any philosophy (Arkansas public school after all) I now asked questions about ethics, the nature of God, what is beauty, morality, and more. I had become a philosopher (though not a good one).Now, 17 years later I've been around the world many times, am nearing the completion of two degrees (psychology and philosophy) and am a much different, much broader, much more deepened soul. The questions I've asked, the roads I've taken, the experiences I've had, are all a result of my search for my own truth. A lot of that was set afire because of reading this book. I know that many bemoan Anne's move from the supernatural and to Christian writings. It's her life and I respect that. Yet I am reminded of something Jung said, we do not become enlighted by imagining beings of light, but by making the darkness visible (I'm paraphrasing). Lestat might not be a being of light (that's another topic) but his darkness is illuminating.This is one of my favorite books ever.\",\n",
       "   \"Dear Anne Rice:NOT WORTHY.Signed, All Fictional Vampires Who Are Not LestatThis was a re-read for me, but in all honesty, I don't think I was ready for this book the first time I read it. Or at least, I didn't appreciate it for the sheer masterpiece of storytelling that it is, and it's not just the mood and the world and the mythology and the fast-moving plot -- more than anything, it's the characters. Lestat, of course, Rice's 'brat prince', arrogant and compassionate and impossible, all at the same time -- he'd be enough to carry any book, imo, but the secondary characters are just as layered and bewitching, probably because we see them through Lestat's eyes. Nicki and his endless internal darkness; Armand, who manages to be both tragic and terrifying; Gabrielle, who seems like a force of nature; and even Louis, the whiny, unreliable narrator from  comes off as beautiful and mysterious, the star-crossed love of Lestat's afterlife. I swooned through the last chapter.I didn't care for the places Rice took this series after Queen of the Damned, but for me, Lestat continues to define the vampire-as-anti-hero genre. No other blood-sucker comes close. \",\n",
       "   'I was raised by an unapologetic bookworm with rather eclectic tastes and whether its nature or nurture, I eventually turned into one of those myself. During my formative years, if I dared to say I was bored to my mother, she would simply throw a book at me and say “Read. You won’t be bored anymore”. It was very good advice, that I keep to this day: you will never catch me without a book in my purse! But the thing about my mother is that most of her library was not children/teenager appropriate, and she does not believe in censorship… so I read an awful lot of very adult books very young. I think that I picked up my first Anne Rice when I was about nine years old.I have read many vampires stories since – some really good and some really bad – and Lestat remains to this day my all-time favorite vampire.Granted, there was a lot of stuff I missed when I read “The Vampire Lestat” the first time because, well, I was nine. But rereading it as an adult made me appreciate it so much more. First off, the amount of historical research that went into creating this book is staggering. Say what you will about Anne Rice as a person (she sounds rather insufferable) but the woman does her homework and weaves an amazing, complex and intricate story that bounces through the Âge des Lumières France, Roman Empire Egypt, colonial era New Orelans and modern day California. I am a sucker for history, so when a historical setting is as vivid as Ms. Rice makes them, I find myself utterly fascinated.Of course, the character of Lestat is what truly makes this book wonderful: he’s a brat, with an greedy curiosity and a devil-may-care attitude that he takes a bit too literally (“If I was a damned thing, then let the son of a bitch come for me!”)… This was my first encounter with a villain who is not really a villain because he’s a bad person and it might just be where my weakness for bad guys comes from! The things about Lestat is that while he can be an absolute monster, he’s also a tortured being who wrestles with a strangely twisted conscience, strong feelings and an insatiable need to be loved. When you read “Interview with the Vampire”, he seems like a selfish, pompous jerk; but his background, so wonderfully detailed in “Vampire Lestat” shows him for what he used to be as a mortal and how the sorrows of his younger days are still a burden he carries within him and tries his best to camouflage by acting like a rock star – ages before such a thing even existed. He is a complex hero/villain, who throws it all in your face with charm and panache – and that is just irresistible.I am glad to see I am not the only one who like this book better than “Interview”: Louis is super whiny and kind of a drama queen, as where Lestat just rocks. The supporting characters are really well fleshed out: the relationship with his mother Gabrielle is wonderful, if somewhat disturbing. The introduction of Marius, who is my second favorite of the Rice vampires, is also a huge plus! His story is fascinating and his voice is just as delightful as Lestat’s, albeit less bratty. And of course, he tells us the massively awesome story of “Those Who Must Be Kept”! This sort of elaborate mythology that blends history with supernatural elements never ceases to fascinate me, and it is beautifully told.I find that the writing also as a sensuality (for lack of a better word – I don’t think it’s erotic, but it’s definitely lush with feels) that “Interview” lacked. There is darkness, but also a humour and poetry to the language that makes it very unique and sumptuous. The philosophical musings about immortality, religion, love and art were a bit nebulous to me when I was young; it made the re-read very fresh because I understood the motivations and struggles of the characters a lot more, adding a new depth to the story.To me, Anne Rice remains a guilty pleasure kind of read, but if you have never read any of her books before I’d recommend “Vampire Lestat” as a good place to start!',\n",
       "   \"The Vampire Lestat is the second book in The Vampire Chronicles series by Anne Rice. I adored the first book, Interview With A Vampire which was told in Louis' perspective, a vampire that Lestat made who clung desperately to his humanity. The Vampire Lestat is Lestat's story told in his perspective. Although I viewed Lestat as somewhat of a villian in the first book, the reader gets a glimpse of Lestat when he was human and first made vampire. His story is long and tours the globe, even with a history lesson of vampire history. The present-day setting of the book is in the 1980's and I loved Lestat's view on the 20th century, along with his view on humanity, good versus evil, life and death, and his fellow vampires. I was pleasantly surprised to see this side of Lestat. Anne Rice's writing remains beautiful, lyrical, and generous with detail. I plan to continue the series.My favorite quote: “None of us really changes over time. We only become more fully what we are.” Anne Rice, The Vampire Lestat (The Vampire Chronicles, #2)\",\n",
       "   \"Oh, how I love Anne Rice.I actually started reading these books after I read Twilight. Yes, surprisingly, I went back to vampire fiction after that. Meyer is a good writer, but once you've met Anne's Vampires, you're never going back. Anyhow, this book was great. It still has the good kind of vampires: the ones that sleep in coffins, drink human blood and burn in the sunlight. This second book in the series wasn't disappointing, although I feared it might be, after reading the amazing 'Interview With The Vampire'. It was also quite interesting, since I read this book after I'd seen the movie 'Queen of the Damned', which is based on this book and the next book. The violin!! Turns out it didn't belong to a girl at all, but to Nicki, a boy. Damn you, untruthful modern cinema. The characters in this book were brilliant, the story-line was good and the ending was awesome. I can't wait to read 'The Queen of the Damned'. I own all of the books in this series and it's about time that I finish them all. Warning: Addicting series!\"],\n",

       "   'Angels & Demons is a 2000 bestselling mystery-thriller novel written by American author Dan Brown. The novel introduces the character Robert Langdon, who recurs as the protagonist of Brown\\'s subsequent novels. Angels & Demons shares many stylistic literary elements with its sequels, such as conspiracies of secret societies, a single-day time frame, and the Catholic Church. CERN director Maximilian Kohler discovers one of the facility\\'s top physicists, Leonardo Vetra, murdered, his chest branded with an ambigram of the word \"Illuminati.\" Kohler contacts Robert Langdon, an expert on the Illuminati, who determines that the ambigram is authentic. Kohler calls Vetra\\'s adopted daughter Vittoria home and it is ascertained that the Illuminati, an ancient anti-religious organization thought extinct, have stolen a canister containing antimatter, a substance with destructive potential comparable to a nuclear weapon. When at CERN, the canister is stored in a unique electrical charger which ensures the antimatter\\'s stability, but when removed, its backup battery provides power for 24 hours, after which the antimatter would fall out of suspension and, on coming into contact with the physical matter of the container, explode. The canister is located somewhere in Vatican City, with a security camera in front of it, as its digital clock counts down to an explosion due to occur at midnight, which will wipe out the Vatican.Langdon and Vittoria make their way to Vatican City, where the Pope has recently died. They are told that the four Preferiti, the cardinals who are most likely to be elected pope, are missing. Langdon and Vittoria search for the preferiti in hopes that they will also find the antimatter canister. Their search is assisted by Camerlengo Carlo Ventresca (the late pope\\'s closest aide), the Vatican\\'s Swiss Guard and Commander Olivetti. ...عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «شیاطین و فرشتگان»؛ «فرشتگان و شیاطین»؛ نویسنده: دن براون؛ تاریخ نخستین خوان: یکی از روزهای سال2007میلادیعنوان: شیاطین و فرشتگان؛ نویسنده: دن براون؛ مترجم: نوشین ریشهری؛ تهران، نگارینه، 1385؛ در 488ص؛ چاپ دوم: تهران، نگارینه، 1395؛ در572ص، شابک 9789647533287؛ موضوع: داستانهای نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده 21معنوان: فرشتگان و شیاطین؛ نویسنده: دن براون؛ مترجم: علیرضا صدیقی؛ تهران، نشر گستر، 1389 در در 554ص، شابک 9786005883183؛ شخصیت «رابرت لانگدون»، و احساسات افراطی او، در باره ی هنر، سمبل شناسی، رمزها، جوامع پنهان، و مناطق خاکستری بین خوبی و بدی، رمان حاضر را شکل داده است، «دن براون» نویسنده ای بسیار باهوش هستند؛چکیده: استاد نمادشناسی دانشگاه «هاروارد»، با همراهی دانشمندی زیبا و مرموز به نام: «ویتوریا وترا»، در مورد ارتباط کشتن یک فیزیکدان در «سرن»، با یک گروه باستانی به نام «اشراقیون»، و رابطه ی آنها با «واتیکان» پژوهش می\\u200cکنند؛ که منجر به دفع یک توطئه توسط اشراقیون می\\u200cشود؛ آنها در نظر دارند، تا «واتیکان» را به هنگام جلسه ی گزینش «پاپ»، منفجر کنند؛ آن دو به کشفی نامعقول، کشفی در درون دخمه\\u200c های مهر و موم شده ی ترسناک، مقبره\\u200c های خطرناک، کلیساهای متروک، و اسرارآمیزترین سرداب روی زمین، پناهگاه فراموش شده ی اشراقیون، دست مییابندتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 28/06/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 01/06/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی',\n",
       "   ' - image from Alwasat.lyThis is the first novel in which the character Robert Langdon appears ( being the most famous) The well-known symbologist is called in by the director of CERN when a renowned scientist is found murdered. The scientist had created anti-matter, in an attempt to demonstrate that divine creation of the universe was scientifically explainable. The scientist has, of course, a brilliant and beautiful daughter. The tale has much payload regarding the Illuminati, an ancient group of scientists who had formed a secret society in opposition to the church. It is fast-paced, and a well made example of the action adventure tale. We learn much about the history of the illuminati, a bit about CERN, but the central questions remain ones of faith and science. It was a fun read, one I felt impelled to return to when free moments appeared.   - image from AceShowBizA few other DBs for your consideration---------------',\n",
       "   \"& I was left... STUNNED! Just, just, stunned. Incredibly, this one is the one to top when it comes to adventure & history and pace & ingenuity.I've recently noticed how much history is revered (rightfully) by the modern authors. This is a different type of historical immersion. This is about bringing it to the forefront... something in the past is incredibly relevant, vital, to the present. Everyone but me had read this, & after Da Vinci Code--that bitch of an overrated heathen--I thought Brown was a phony (in company of Nicholas Sparks, among others). Not so. This is a MASTERPIECE indeed. I read this in like two sittings. All 710 pages of oversized print.I was soooo hooked I recalled many other lesser books that have riveted me. This one is so incredibly put together, it is no wonder Brown has been heralded by the general readership, ingrained in the zeitgeist.The awesomeness of this work lies in the battle between science and religion, perhaps one of the most seminal works about that topic. It explores this duality literally, symbolically... every which way. That they are married, both science and religion, is the thesis. Brown proves this with the precision of a skilled scientist. & with the heart of a devout... historian.\",\n",
       "   'I read this after the drivel that is called \"Da Vinci Code.\" I decided to give the author another chance, and take on something that maybe wasn\\'t so formulaic. No dice. I am convinced that Dan Brown does absolutely no research into the subjects he writes about. Or if he does, he decides it is not \"titilating enough for him\" so he makes it up. I mean why even include actual real things in his books if he chooses to ignore any facts about them. Opus Dei? I doubt he could spell it. Catholic Church? Has he even read any history about the Catholic Church at all? His descriptions of the Church seem to be based on whatever anti-Catholic propoganda he could find, Chick Tracts, and superstition. So it comes to no surprise that he has 2 massive bestsellers that are more or less, anti-Catholic. Cuz you know, Catholic baiting and prejudice to the Catholic Church is the only real acceptable prejudice left. The underlying superstition and hostility towards Catholicism, priests, the Pope, Vatican, etc is very close to the same sentiments that lingered in the decades and centuries before WWII in Europe. Think I am overreacting? If someone wrote these books but instead baited the Jews or Muslims there would be a huge outcry. Bashing Catholics and depicting them and their history in the way Dan Brown does in these books is outrageous and should be criticized and shunned. And I didn\\'t even delve into how awful of a writer he is, did I? The only thing more embarassing than his writing that will never be remembered 20 years from now, is the fact that so many people bought into his piece of shit and wasted their time with it. Including respectable people like Tom Hanks and Ron Howard. There\\'s time you will never get back again. Congrats! '],\n",
