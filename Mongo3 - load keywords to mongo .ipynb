This is HOW ccampaigns are PLANNED and then EXECUTED. But reading a great deal of background material will help enormausly\", '', \"This was a mixed bag for me. The positives are that D'Este is comprehensive in his research, provides a ton of sources to corroborate ideas, and is impartial throughout. These are all important things for providing worthwhile historical accounts of real events. The negatives are that D'Este focuses way too much on strategy rather than actual actions and what the events were like, he gets bogged down in providing a dozen corroborating sources when only three or four are needed, and he manages to strip away all of the emotion and drama of the events. It was informative but I prefer accounts that draw me in.\", 'This is not a history of the Normandy campaign; rather, it’s an examination of the command decisions and some, not all, of the operations within. Of the landings, only Sword Beach is covered in detail. The taking of Cherbourg is not covered; we just know it happened. I wish the Cobra breakthrough received a more detailed accounting. It may help a reader to look at Wikipedia, or read Hastings’ or Beevor’s accounts before to learn more of the whole campaign.The author critically examines General Montgomery and the British army’s actions during this campaign and finds much to fault. The army suffers from failure of coordination and a lack of manpower at the strategic level. The author takes Monty to task with an in-depth examination of what he claimed to do, or was going to do, and what he actually did. There was a difference! Chapter 26 on the Falaise action (or lack of it) was hard to follow, yet the failure to close the pocket wasn’t fatal. So what’s the point? The campaign was finally a success, wasn’t it? True, it didn’t enhance Monty’s reputation, but the author gives him points for his overall excellence in training and planning. Readers familiar with Alamein and the action at the Mareth Line know that Monty could flex when he needed to. There were times when I wondered this could be as mean-spirited as David Irving’s , yet overall there is enough excellent history of the command decisions that had to be made to make this book well worth reading.', \"There is detail here and to the extent that the book explores the decision making process that formed a battle plan, and then evaluates how it played out, it is thought provoking for those interested in military strategy. However as others have surely said, there is a repetitive refrain here about how FoS Monty was, that comes back again and again. It would be an interesting if tiresome exercise to pick out how many times we are re-informed in a single-line sentence that Monty was inclined to arrange the facts to fit the story he wished to put forward. As if the reader needed to be reacquainted with the thesis statement periodically, just in case he forgot the thrust of case being built throughout so many sections of the book.I'm no expert in the field, but there does appear to be a trend in scholarship in harmony with what seemed to be Monty's long lived quest after the war - to rewrite the common evaluation of his generalship more favorably. This book is steadfastly, repetitively on the other side of that argument.Having said that, no one including D'Este sees Monty as any sort of massive failure as a strategist in what was ultimately a successful invasion and break out. And really, how much fault lies with the commander when the battle plans are implemented in such a way that the objectives are not met, as was the case in many operations aimed at taking Caen? It does seem that Monty was an inveterate fudger, spinner, slanter and credit taker throughout his career and his inconsistencies with facts on the ground appear to be whoppers. Hard not to concede that there was a pattern there. But what we may sometimes fail to appreciate is that his was a thankless job with many factors to balance (Ike-like, if you will) including war weariness at home and on the line, a man power shortage (however you regard the claim/efficacy of the 100k reserve on the British mainland), an incredible ability on the part of the enemy to resist in the face of dwindling resources and unprecedented bombardment and...general heavy sledding as regards of the taking of objectives. Plus, with the end of the war on the horizon, no one above him in the UK establishment would have welcomed boat rocking or anything that would weaken their hand in post war negotiations. What he did do was keep the situation together in a way that bent but did not break - he prevented disaster - so that the inexorable build up of numbers close to the coast where the allies could exercise the key tactical advantages of air superiority/naval and artillery bombardment would eventually reveal the opportunity for a coup de grâce and win the day. Be that as it may, a good and informative book on the Normandy invasion if you can tolerate the repetitious, unvarying barrage of criticism of the manner of Monty's fighting and, more to the point, characterizing the war.\"], 'Genre': ['History', 'War', 'World War II', 'Nonfiction', 'Military', 'Military History', 'War', 'Military Fiction', 'War', 'History', 'World History', 'European Literature', 'British Literature', 'History', 'European History', 'Earth', 'The World'], 'Summary': ['Here, for the first time in paperback, is an outstanding military history that offers a dramatic new perspective on the Allied campaign that began with the invasion of the D-Day beaches of Normandy.

And not just the famous Caucasoid burials of China, but a highly complete account of the Indo-European diaspora, including data on language roots and ancient technology. Exactly what I’d been searching for most my adult life all here in one neat book. Four stars for colloquial grammar and some repetitive info.Notes :--------\".. Most of the huge territory that China governs is not fit for agriculture, being either mountain or desert or both.\"\"According to Chinese historical documents, the Han Chinese themselves began to move into Central Asia only around 120 B.C., struggling to open up regular trade with the West.\"\"The famous mummies of Egypt appear dry and shriveled, blackened like discarded walnut husks, compared with these life-like remains.\"\"... Scholars had discovered in this same area a variety of documents dating from the first millenium AD, and written in a now-extinct language known as Tokharian... related to the Indo-European tongues...\"\"Outside of Egypt, you find a presentable piece of cloth in a prehistoric dig about as often as you find a ruby in your oatmeal. Yet here, and for the same reason as in Egypt, ancient textiles come out of the ground by the armload.\"\"...Once cloth became common late in the New Stone Age, about 4000 BC, textile production soon swallowed more labor hours than even the production and processing of food, becoming the most important ancient industry. But whereas the sophisticated Egyptians labored to produce masses of plain white linen, the countryfolk of the Tarim Basin wove and bedecked themselves in garment of vivid color that has survived with astounding brightness.\"\"...The textiles from at least one of these Inner Asian sites look astonishingly like the peculiar plaid twill cloths found in the only place in Europe where ancient perishables have survived well, the Bronze Age salt mines... in the Alps above Salzburg... woven by ancestors of the Celts...\" \"...The most famous is a 3000 year old man... He would have been an imposing figure in life, for he once stood 6 feet tall...\"\"A few bodies - the ones best preserved - turned out to be covered with a strange yellow fuzz or dust that lay under the clothes, directly on the skin... Tests indicate it was some sort of animal protein... Mummies found in the high, dry Andes Mountains of Peru often had their skins painted with a thin fish paste...\"\"The Cherchen people had such a fondness for clothes that they took piles of apparel with them to the next world. This single excavation, for example, produced 10 hats, each different.\"\"A horse skull from the Ukranian site of Dereivka, dated to about 4000 BC, shows characteristic tooth wear that suggests the horse had chomped on a bit for several hundred hours during its life; it was not only domesticated but closely controlled.\"\"Being merely matted sheep\\'s wool. felt requires no loom.\"\"The whole process of raising the yurt takes about an hour.\"\"The Egyptians already had sleeved linen shirts in the First Dynasty, around 3000 BC... But sleeved clothing did not remain popular in Egypt... The people of Europe and the steppes seem not to have picked up the notion until the second millenium BC...\"\"The Cherchen woman, as I shall call her, must also have been imposing in life, because she too stood well over 6 feet tall...\"\"A pair of unusual gifts lay with the child : a small cow\\'s horn cup, and what may be the world\\'s earliest preserved nursing bottle, fashioned, nipple and all, from the udder of a sheep...\"\"Although sheep had been among the first animals domesticated around 8000 BC in the Near East, it took 4000 years of inbreeding to come up with usably woolen ones.\"\"The only fibers that people had before that - namely, plant stem fibers like linen and hemp (used since 25,000 BC, at least) - don\\'t stretch, whereas wool fibers can stretch tremendously...\"\"...The makers had invented a weaver\\'s equivalent of the old jeweler\\'s trick of mounting tinfoil behind a gem to reflect a light through it more brightly. In this case, although the warp inside the main cloth was dark brown, within the collar it was peach pink... just enough to alter the hue.\"\"My favorite textile of all depicts a row of sassy-looking Angali sheep with big curving eyes and large brown or bright blue eyes... I wonder whether the weaver got that idea from the people of Cherchen. After all, someone had gone to the trouble of finding blue stones - something of a rarity - to place over the infant [mummy]\\'s eyes, and a remarkable number of the non-Chinese people in the Tarim Basin today have blue eyes.\"\"A small section... in the tapestry consisted of a slightly paler and much silkier fiber than the rest... it was cashmere, the fine hair of a type of goat named after its home in Kashmir, just north of India.\"\"... We visited a somewhat later cemetery site, dating to about 500 BC, where nearby villagers had looted many of the remaining graves the minute the Urumchi archaeologists left for the season.... All about lay finger and leg bones, a jaw here, a pate there - old bones had no value to the robbers, so they chucked them everywhere.\"\"...His team had found 1 gold earring and 2 gold beads in this cemetery, while excavating a dozen graves. On the strength of that, the locals had spaded up 20 or 30 more, and might have dug all the way to Urumchi if they had found local treasure.\"\"... All the Central Asia textiles at this early period are made of sheep\\'s wool, for both sheep and wheat were domesticated in the Near East... Neither of these two cultigens could possibly have arrived from the east, from China, since neither of them existed there yet...\"\"... Early folk all over the Loulan area marked the grave by erecting posts, so that their cemeteries came to look like small forests of poles.... The most remarkable of these... belong to a small series of strictly made graves... The posts sit so close together that one cannot walk between them; perhaps this ruse discouraged the local wolves and other carnivorous predators from disturbing the dead.\"\"Caravans coming from China passed westward ... to Dunhuang at the east edge of the Tarim and Turfan basins. There they passed into the desert through a part of the Chinese defense line called the Jade Gate, so named because most of the beautiful jade considered sacred in China since the Stone Age came from western provinces beyond this point.\"\"So here on the great wide flats the Chinese military test their A-bombs, assured of privacy...\"\"The new loom that arrived in Egypt from Syria about 1500 BC however was vertical and it had the great advantage that... you could see better what you did it. That\\'s why the Egyptians adopted it, sit came along with captive instructors in the art of making a new and intricately patterned cloth - namely , tapestry. (Before that the Egyptians wore plain white cloth and used their world-famous jewelry to dress up.)\"\"Chinese thus ranks as the longest-running written tradition in the world, by far, even if not the earliest.\"\"When salt water freezes, the salt separates out and only the water freezes. So the Tarim explorers, like those in the Arctic zones, could use winter ice as a source of nonsalty water.\"\"Kharoshti script was used to write an Indic tongue called Prakrit, imported from India in the 3rd century AD and serving for a short time thereafter as a common language for government functionaries all across the southern Tarim Basin... the rules for acceptable word shapes in Indic are more widely accommodating than those of Chinese...\"\"...The ancient Chinese viewed the natives of the Kingdom of Loulan as \\'resembling birds and wild beasts.\\' Stein and Hedin too, traveling before cars and roads reached the area, frequently remark that the \\'Lopliks\\' they encountered -- the non-Chinese inhabitants of the few miserable fishing villages in the Lop Nor and the Qara-Qoshun area -- had scarcely progressed beyond a late Stone Age economy even then.\"\"Until they became the passageway between East and West, the people of Lop had nothing they needed to defend with strong walls, nothing anybody else wanted... Unlettered and unvisited, they left almost no trace in written history.\"\"... Quite a few words attested in Old Chinese have turned out to have Indo-European etymologies. For example, a whole cluster of Chinese words to do with wheels, wheel spokes, axles, and chariots - all objects first invented in west-central Eurasia...\"\"Nomadic herders in the steppe zone north of the Tarim Basin specialized in making felt, not in weaving...\"\"... For all their skill at weaving wool, the prehistoric Loulan people made pretty indifferent felt - not at all like true nomads. So of the 2 ways of making cloth, weaving was apparently the older and more comfortable technology among these people when they entered Central Asia from the west.\"\"The Celts have been weaving plaid twills for 3,000 years at least.\"\"For nearly a millenium before their expansion, the early Celts had lived in present-day western Hungary, Austria, and southern Germany, an area from they had entered from the east apparently in search of metals to mine.\"\"During the first millenium BC, Celtic communities grew rich exporting salt and salted meat to the growing civilizations of Greece and Rome, just south of them, importing wine and other luxuries in return.\"\"A radical change about 4000 BC in the pattern if slaughtering domestic sheep (killing them old to maximize wool and milk harvested, instead of killing them as yearlings to minimize the care needed to reap one feast and one hide) signals the development of sheep with usable wool on their backs. By 3500 BC these woolly sheep had reached places as far away as the Balkans, a thousand miles from Mesopotamia.\" \"Our first evidence of horse taming comes from Ukraine around 4000 BC.\"\"The earliest wheel yet found in the steppes - in Ukraine - dates to about 3200 BC\"\"Almost every known grave of the Loulan/Qawrighul culture has proved to contain carefully bundled twiglets of identified as ephedra.\"\"The everyday Greek garb, a mere wraparound, contained no pockets, so people habitually used their mouths for carrying coins.\"\"Inside the White Room vessels at early Gonur, Russian scientists found residues identifiable as ephedra and hemp, while at nearby Togolok, the White Room residues deposited a few centuries later proved to contain ephedra and poppy.\"\"...The Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Xuanzang... set out from China to travel the 2500 miles to India via the Tarm Basin in AD 628... The round trip took him 17 years...\"\"Compared with the gentle curve of the chimp\\'s air passage, adult humans have a sharp right angle bend, making strong breathing (as when running) much less efficient.\" \"...Indic names and vocabulary words turn up in written records of the Near East in the Bronze Age, starting soon after 2000 BC, words like , the Indic word for \\'horse\\'...\". ', \"If you're an efficient-minded person, don't bother to read this review. Just go buy the book and read it immediately. I'd recommend you just get all of Barber's books. She is a rare talent--an amazing scholar who puts her learning to great practical use who can also write engaging, lovely prose.Just get all of her books while you're at the store. It'll save you valuable time that could be spent pouring over Barber's writing.This particular book explains the discovery of and research on some ancient mummified caucasoid bodies discovered in the Tarim Basin, which is north of Tibet and south of Mongolia. Barber, both a brilliant linguist and a fiber artist who has studied ancient techniques, was invited to the region, which is now part of China, to study the bodies and their clothing. Many archaeologists and linguists agree that the mummified folks were Tocharian speakers, thus Indo-Europeans. They seem to have been permanently settled in the area. What is most interesting to most of us fiber heads is the clothing these people made. Even after about 3,000 years of burial, their clothes are bright red and yellow and blue. They wear twill plaids, woven in a structure that is otherwise particular to Celtic tribes in Europe in the Iron Age. They painted swirling designs on their faces, much like Celts did during their battles with Rome, much later.Just read the book. I'm too excited to keep writing about it, because thinking of it makes me pick the book right back up. So just read the book. And stare at the gorgeous photos. And then learn to weave and dye--you'll be forced to, I tell ya. \", 'The Mummies of Ürümchi is (a) an intricate discourse on textile production of the first few millennia b.c. (I will never take cloth for granted again!); (b) a compelling reassemblage of Central Asian linguistic history; (c) an expansive depiction of the effects of geography and ecology on lifestyle; and (d) very accessibly written - Elizabeth Wayland Barber chooses apt descriptive metaphors to illustrate her points and she keeps her analysis rolling like a good story. And these attributes all in the service of explicating the origins of some mystery mummies unearthed in the Tarim Basin desert of Central Asia. Barber demonstrates that a preponderance of evidence exists in favor of a western Indo-European provenance for these mummies. In doing so, she also draws attention to the great cultural commerce that has occurred on the Central Asian plain for millennia - a commerce that seldom moved in one direction but instead flowed from west to east and back again and was determined by the cleverness of the technology being shared (more sophisticated looms, woollier sheep, et al.), rather than by diplomatic relations or national philosophies. This focus, as well as her respect for scholars with different agendas, makes this an especially refreshing read, as the other main groups of researchers working on the mummies at the time were from China and the then Soviet Union, neither nation precisely renowned for a-political scholarship. One senses that Ms. Barber tried very assiduously to keep her analysis rooted in the past and away from modern concerns about national identity. (I think, for instance, of the ongoing Mongolian-Chinese contention over which nation can rightfully claim Genghis Khan. And Ms. Barber, after all, is not from Central Asia, so she has perhaps less stake in this sort of question. At any rate, Barber does not participate in nationalistic discourse and, thereby, her work serves only to highlight how very strange it is that modern scholars occasionally seek to make past facts conform to present political climates, rather than attend past facts on their own terms and for their own sakes. Barber does not require history to fit her pre-imagined conclusions. The truth is quite interesting enough as it is.', 'This is a fascinating book that ought to be more widely known. Not only is it in some respects an engrossing tale of the many paths that research opens for the curious, whether scientist or general reader, it gives glimpses of worlds of which I at least was completely ignorant. I read it when I was working on the chapter on Scotland and Ireland in my , looking for some backstory to the drama of the Celts. The conceit my book is built around is that many places have very much in common but have developed in very different ways. Catholic Ireland and Protestant Scotland seemed a brilliant example of the phenomena since both have their roots in Celtic culture, and for a long time spoke languages which were cousins. Not much about the Irish and the Scots in this book, but it shows how the culture has it roots in Central Asia. The mummies in question are remarkably \"Caucasian\" looking, and the textiles some of them are dressed in are very like the plaids that were so proudly worn by Scots and Irish. The journey obviously was long, but it seems that people, ideas and techniques travelled long distances.Definitely worth reading...', \"This book is like a detective story in which the hero is an expert in ancient textiles, except that she's also the author.The mystery is, why are 4000-year old blond Caucasian people buried in a desert in (what is now) western China?The author employs linguistic and archaeological evidence, but what holds her analysis together and renders it fascinating is her dissection of the cloth these mummies were wearing. The cloth turns out to hold the key to the identity of these people - whose language, it also turns out, I had heard of, but no one knew who spoke it.The writing is engaging and kept me interested all the way through. Now, granted, I love languages and archeology, and ancient central Asia captivates me, so of course this book was just my bag. Anyone who is interested in textiles and the history of cloth production would probably also enjoy it.\"], 'Genre': ['History', 'History', 'Archaeology', 'Nonfiction', 'Cultural', 'China', 'Anthropology', 'Cultural', 'Asia', 'History', 'Ancient History', 'Science', 'History', 'Prehistory', 'Archaeology', 'Antiquities'], 'Summary': ['In the museums of Urumchi, the wind-swept regional capital of the Uyghur Autonomous Region in Western China, a collection of ancient mummies date back as far as 4,000 years -- contemporary to the famous Egyptian mummies, but even more beautifully preserved, especially their clothing.

What were these blond Caucasians doing in the heart of Asia? Where did they come from and what language did they speak?
