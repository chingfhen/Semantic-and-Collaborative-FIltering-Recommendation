    "# ABOUT:\n",
    "- this code puts together semanticSearch(): filter by genre and quantized ids > rank by CrossEncoder\n",
    "- background:\n",
    "    - in previous notebooks, found that filtering books by genre and quantized ids is efficient and produces a small set of results that are relevant \n",
    "    - finally, i will rerank these results using a CrossEncoder to obtain a more accurate set of results\n",
    "- approach:\n",
    "    - given a query\n",
    "        - semantically guess the users desired genres\n",
    "        - acquire product quantization of summary\n",
    "        - retrieve candidate results \n",
    "    - Rerank using CrossEncoder\n",
    "        - loop through the Mongo Cursor \n",
    "        - for each document compute similarity between query and book summary\n",
    "        - Use PriorityQueue to keep track of the topk most similar results    \n",
    "- motivation and advantages:\n",
    "    - before, we found that filtering by genre and quantized ids produce a small set of relevant results efficiently\n",
    "    - CrossEncoder is relatively slower but more accurate \n",
    "    - as a result, this two staged semantic retrieval is fast, yet accurate.\n",
    "- outcome:\n",
    "   - number of matching genres should be taken into considering when ranking\n",
    "   - quantization ids might be very noisy "

She broadens the subject of prayer to art, poetry, reflection, any action that lends itself to communicating with God. Yet, she shows it is of utmost importance in the Christian life. Sprinkling the text with Scripture, as well as passages from the BCP, this is no syncretic attempt to discuss prayer in the pluralistic society. This book is distinctly Christian, distinctly Anglican, and very thorough. Gunther emphasizes important practices such as confession and the importance of a spiritual director.'],\n",

It was written in 1992 so some of the statistics need to be updated. That can easily be done on the internet these days. But the Biblical challenge that it offers is as valid as it was when it was written. ',\n",
       "    'Unveiled at Last is a worthy read for every global missions enthusiast. Its central message is to read the Bible as one book illuminating God’s heart for salvation to all people groups. Much of the book outlines what Bob Sjogren calls \"Top Line/Bottom Line Theology\" (the book was rewritten in 2014 with a new title of God\\'s Bottom Line), where the \"top line\" of many Bible passages is that God blesses us, as He did Abram in Genesis 12:1-3, for the purpose of a \"bottom line\"--to be a blessing to others. He develops this model extensively throughout Scripture. While I certainly agree with the main point, it seems that at times he may contort some passages to fit the model. This book was written in 1992 when many mission strategists were awash with vision of evangelizing all unreached people groups by the year 2000--the AD2000 Movement. Of course, this goal was unrealized and the movement became AD2000 and Beyond, but if the church had heeded Sjogren\\'s impassioned pleas as articulated in this book, perhaps each people group on earth would indeed have been engaged by Christian workers by the turn of the millennium. I\\'m still scratching my head on his proposition that God intentionally blinded Israel\\'s spiritual eyes because He knew they would disobey His plan for them to be a light to the nations (Chapter 6: God\\'s Mercy through Blindness). As a mercy, He gave them spiritual blindness so they would not be accountable for the sin they would have committed otherwise. Sjogren fits both Old and New Testament passages on Israel\\'s blindness and God hardening Israel\\'s heart into this theory. His reasoning kind of fits, but I\\'m left wondering, \"Does God really do that?\" ',\n",
       "    'Written in the 1990s, this is still an enlightening look at God’s plan from Genesis 3 to the end - to reveal Himself to all nations. The great commission given by Jesus was a re-stating of God’s eternal purpose - that all the people, tribes and languages will know that He is Lord. The book fleshes out instance after instance in the Bible to show this thread - from the location of Israel as a trade stop in the ancient world, to the story of Jonah going to the gentiles, to the missionary journeys of Paul.

       "    \"Fear and Trembling is a philosophical work by Søren Kierkegaard, published in 1843 under the pseudonym Johannes de Silentio (John of the Silence). Kierkegaard wanted to understand the anxiety that must have been present in Abraham when Abraham had a choice to complete the task or to refuse to comply to God's orders.

       "    'Many readers come to read this book via the Hegel pathway. Or at least realize that a Hegel preamble is required. And most probably such a preamble is indispensable.Alas, I came to it through a side door. As an attendant of a cycle of lectures given at the on the Bible (Old Testament) and Art, I listened, and looked, in fascination to the exposé of one of the Speakers. He examined the myth of  and the  of his beloved son.After portraying what he considered an utterly unethical behavior in the part of Abraham he presented Kierkegaard’s ideas as the only way to approach the dreadful myth. For it cannot be understood.For such is the nature of Paradox.Abraham was no  (*). There was no heroism in his act: Agamemnon was driven by duty; Abraham by faith. Agamemnon could hate his own act but overcome his hatred and announce the intended outcome. Abraham, as the  could not doubt a single instant. He had to want to kill his son, while loving him dearly, because his god had ordered him to do so. And this he had to do quietly.And so at the core of Abraham’s act was the Absurd.In this context of absurdity silence, elastic, takes its place. And opens the door to laughter.And of the painters,, the master of capturing the interruption, was also the one who represented the force in Abraham’s unrelenting and unvacillating will. There is no second-guessing god in his Abraham. No acting and no hope. Rembrandt was the one painter who understood what Kierkegaard stated about two hundred years later. Angel had to fight hard to stop Abraham in his unflinching intention to murder.------Do I need to point out that Beckett read this book?---(*) another example of this paternal filicide not mentioned in this book is Emperor Frederick II and his son Henry.',\n",

So nothing has changed since the time of the Danish state church.But, believe me, those very words can kill.Especially to the Edwardians who chanced upon Kierkegaard back in the old days. For in those days (even before Walter Lowry started translating K) the words conjured up the loud abjuration \"work out your salvation with Fear and Trembling!”That is, if we insatiable consumers ever got to the point where our life is no longer a matter for polite, double-edged chuckles. And it\\'s not, you know.Guess what? It\\'s REAL and it HURTS!You know, I\\'m the kinda guy who has amassed a vast assortment of glosses, summaries and guides to Kierkegaard. He\\'s that tough to read. And this slim book, being short, might otherwise seem easy. But it\\'s not.For one thing, Kierkegaard - unlike so many wiseacres these days - doesn\\'t skew his segues. Nor does he, like them, cover his sins in bland sameness. He always gets us to the same somewhat tediously recirculating point. BUT the dull camouflage of his circling gets us there in new and startling ways, it we’re at all awake.Wanna wake up?By far the best \"guide\" to this book is another alluringly slim volume, Jacques Derrida\\'s Literature in Secret. You should get it, if you want to figure Kierkegaard out!Here\\'s how Derrida makes Kierkegaard clear as MUD:He dwells, not on the conviction of his paradoxes - no. For by extrapolating on and reworking the subtle areas of Fear and Trembling (at which point readers like me CRY OUT for a simple Crib Sheet) he takes our minds further and further out into the cold Arctic of a terra incognita. With nary a comfort.NOW we\\'re totally lost.And we’re ITCHING for a distraction. A beer. Or TV. Or at least a smoke!Sound familiar? We’re ALL like that. Me, too…You see, don\\'t you, that Derrida clarifies Kierkegaard by showing him to us as he must have seemed to the author\\'s Original 19th Century audience: as something so totally FOREIGN to their habitual comfort zones that suddenly they HAD TO THINK FOR THEMSELVES? Just as Socrates did for the Athenians. So they killed him off. An enemy of the state, just like Soren Kierkegaard.Therefore, Derrida\\'s is THE Ideal Crib Sheet. We media-crazed 21st Century couch potatoes are now for the first time, THINKING FOR OURSELVES.The perfect methodology to apply to our nail-biting Finals for our Introduction to Modern Thought 101 class.It is our REAL initiation.And THAT was Kierkegaard\\'s Intent.And, that’s the \"meaning\" of this complex book, in a Nutshell!',\n",
       "    ' is Kierkegaard’s astonishingly dexterous analysis of faith via the Old Testament story of Abraham and Isaac: According to Kierkegaard, Abraham was a true “knight of faith.” He didn’t merely resign himself to losing his son, but instead believed that Isaac wouldn’t actually be harmed. He had faith based on “the strength of the absurd,” or in spite of the fact that it made no rational sense to do so. Kierkegaard contended that Abraham’s belief in this undeniable absurdity elevated him to the highest plane of faith one can possibly hope to attain.Kierkegaard then made an apparently simple (yet really rather profound) point: Abraham’s decision to make a leap of faith could not concern itself with the OUTCOME of that leap:Kierkegaard concluded this section of the book by stating that faith is fundamentally a paradox, and that it goes beyond what reason can comprehend. He then proceeded to examine three “problemata.”   Kierkegaard answered in the affirmative. Basically, taking care of your fellow human beings is generally your most important ethical concern. However, since murdering a helpless  doesn’t usually provide much benefit to humanity, and yet God commanded Abraham to do so, ethical considerations must have been suspended in favor of a higher imperative.  Short answer: Yes. Slightly longer explanation: Kierkegaard held that  I tinkered with the previous quote in an effort to make it more user friendly. Kierkegaard was kind of a dweeb with some of his jargon and specialized slang. Perhaps also with his coiffure:  Kierkegaard was of the opinion that honesty is usually the best policy. In Abraham’s case, however, since his task was Absurd with a capital A, and as such could not possibly be understood, he had to grapple with it alone. Abraham couldn’t even attempt to relate it to anyone else, since trying to explain what is absurd and incomprehensible is…well…absurd.Kierkegaard wrapped things up by asserting that  and that this is something each person must wrestle with and ultimately earn for themselves.Thus concludes my (probably overly detailed) summary of the main points presented in the book. I’d now like to share a few of Kierkegaard’s more brilliant quotes:Overall, Kierkegaard was a phenomenal writer with an often merciless wit. His mind was arrestingly complex, nimble, fluid. I can’t claim to fully grasp everything he wrote; at times I got tangled up in the threads of his subtly nuanced logic, especially when I was frantically trying to keep up with some of his more peculiar terminology. That said, many of his points were beautifully reasoned, some even striking in their clarity. I especially appreciated his musings on the suffering that standing alone with your beliefs necessarily entails, and the importance of not letting the pain erode your resolve. Although the aforementioned merits made this a fascinating read, I couldn’t wholly relate to it, as I do not count religious faith among the more worthwhile pursuits available to us as thinking beings. I  agree with him on this:I just tend to side with Hitchens as to its rather dubious value:'],\n",

Años después de su publicación, el filósofo danés anotaba en su diario: «Cuando yo haya muerto bastará mi libro “Temor y Temblor” para convertirme en un escritor inmortal. Se leerá, se traducirá a otras lenguas, y el espantoso pathos que contiene esa obra hará temblar. En la época en que fue escrita, cuando su autor se escondía tras la apariencia de un flâneur, nadie podía sospechar la seriedad que encerraba este libro. […] Pero una vez muerto, se me convertirá en una figura irreal, una figura sombría…, y el libro resultará pavoroso».'],\n",

       "   'Review': [\"For the last decade or so, most of us have had to form some kind of opinion on religious fundamentalism, and it's a subject which can very easily become hysterical, sensational or just terrifying when it's addressed by the mass media. This exceptional book, which came out a few years ago now, is a careful examination of fundamentalism in Islam, Christianity and Judaism, and it tries to answer the basic questions many people feel – who the hell are these people, and how can they believe what they believe?As a jumping-off point, Armstrong points to an ancient distinction between two forms of truth (as described by the Greeks): mythos and logos. Logos is scientific, rational truth which has allowed us to build cars and bridges and visit other planets. Mythos is a different kind of truth, found in myth, art, and in the beliefs of religion. The central theme of her book is that fundamentalism is essentially the result of confusing one kind of truth with another.As she demonstrates, pre-modern peoples saw religion as belonging firmly to the realm of mythos. Religion was concerned with stories and concepts not to be taken literally, but used as ways to consider the nature of humanity, our relationship to the spiritual, and our place in the world. Logos is useful for science and politics, but it cannot answer the big questions of existence: that is the job of mythos, and the two realms of truth were kept very separate until a few hundred years ago. But after the Enlightenment, when rationalism became so effective and so much a part of life, there was a gradual change of mood, and an increased sense that scientific truth was more important than spiritual or mythic truths. Mythos became sidelined and subsequently discredited as ‘only’ a myth. It was, Armstrong argues, in reaction to this mentality that some religious groups, feeling threatened, attempted to reinterpret mythos as logos, taking religious concepts as being literally true, and using them as a basis for legislation and political life.Using this distinction between scientific and spiritual truths makes for an interesting reexamination of historical issues: the Reformation, for instance, becomes a clash between idea systems. In the pre-modern Catholic church, the Eucharist was a rich spiritual symbol of human participation in the divine. But for the rational Reformers, it must either be literally true (Luther), or else plain false (Zwingli, Calvin). They were unable to see beyond scientific truth. Similarly, for many Orthodox Jews in the 1930s and '40s, the idea of a modern State of Israel was deeply abhorrent. For them, Israel was a profound symbol of their religion, a vital part of Jewish spirituality to be contemplated – not a place to make a farm and start tilling sacred soil. When many of the ultra-Orthodox considered a kibbutz, Armstrong writes, they ‘felt the same outrage and dread as, later, people felt when the heard about the Nazi death camps.’ She adds, ‘This is not an exaggeration,’ and cites Jewish clerics who actually blamed the Holocaust on the settlement of Israel.By pointing to such fundamental differences of opinion, Armstrong shows that most contemporary fundamentalist movements are in fact decidedly modern, despite the fact that they all profess a wish to go ‘back to basics’. The literalism which is seen in fundamentalism is a concept which is really only a few centuries old.She is particularly strong when it comes to Islam, pointing out that while Western Europe had three or four hundreds years to adjust to modern rationalism, most Islamic countries had such ideas foisted on them more or less overnight by colonial powers (generally Britain, France, Russia and later the US). It is difficult for most of us to understand, for example, why terrorists seem to hate democracy, but she points out that the Islamic experience of democracy has been very different from ours – imposed on a country in one fell swoop, and usually resulting in a lot of business contracts for foreign companies, and a lot of money for those in power but little for anyone else. Her case studies of Egypt and Iran make this point beyond doubt, and show the importance of making a place for religion in society, to prevent it from becoming sidelined and hence feeling threatened.If you're from the UK or the States, the book is not comfortable reading, since most of the problems in the Middle East are traced squarely back to Western interference, and in some cases the details are heartbreaking. In particular, America's complete failure to understand Islamic societies throws a lot of light on the Iranian Revolution as well as the rise in reactionary groups, and reading this won't make you feel too hopeful about Iraq's or Afghanistan's chances, let alone the way Iran itself is currently being dealt with.But this is far from being an exclusively Islamic problem; rather, the book shows that fundamentalism is just a reaction to the secularism of modern life, a frightened response to the ‘God-shaped hole’ which Sartre talked about, or Nietzsche's ‘God is dead’. We have lost an appreciation of mythos in the West – though many people feel the lack of it, which may explain the popularity of such things as tarot cards, dream dictionaries and psychoanalysis. In that sense, this book, while clearly condemning the abuses of fundamentalism, is equally unimpressed by modern secularism. ‘If fundamentalists must evolve a more compassionate assessment of their enemies in order to be true to their religious traditions,’ she writes, ‘secularists must also be more faithful to the benevolence, tolerance and respect for humanity which characterizes modern culture at its best, and address themselves more empathetically to the fears, anxieties and needs which so many of their fundamentalist nieghbours experience’. These movements do not represent a knee-jerk reaction, but a considered response to modernity, and unless we try and understand that, the problems will not go away.This is an important book. Suffice to say that if you have any interest in religion, politics, history or current affairs then you will get something out of it. I hope as many people as possible read it.\",\n",
       "    \"My goal is to formulate a gospel of atheism which is so full of loving-kindness that all the Christians and everyone else too, why not be ambitious, will join me and their migraines caused by their impossible theology will cease, their gnarled hearts caused by their doctrinal disagreeablenesses will unclench and we can all form a circle of lambent fulfilledness which will wink and pulse gently like tacky Christmas tree lights as we bask in the suddenly clear and perfect knowledge of the absolute remarkableness of being here at all, that's all, just being here on a strange planet being able to breathe, and that's it, no heaven, no hell, no fees, no guru, no method, no teaching, no mantra, nothing special, just that.Of course, if I did, that would be a self-contradiction. And a bit Lennony. But I could live with that. \",\n",
       "    \"An examination of religious fundamentalism is an arduous undertaking for any reader, and not simply because it necessitates immersion into a different cultural perspective. The sheer voltage of psychic violence brandished by some of these sects injects the issue with a heavy dose of repellence. That's the irony, of course. Making atrocity your weapon of choice will, yes, absolutely garner worldwide attention. You will be seen as you have hungered to be seen. Does it matter that this will frequently occur through the crosshairs of a rifle scope?And there is a taste of the journey, as a reader and a thinker, through the terrain most recently inhabited by Al Qaeda and ISIS. Terrorism is designed to terrorize and all the images we possess - whether they be of the corpse of a serviceman dragged through foreign streets, a passenger jet slamming into the World Trade Center, or a journalist's beheading - will rise to mind to tap that terror on the road to developing an understanding of this element of society as it operates today.This issue is highly-charged for me, and so it becomes critically important that I choose my authors with care. It's easy enough at present to fall into the hands of cynics and rabble-rousers; the scornful academic, the conspiracy theorist, the tabloid instigator; anyone with a motive that departs, modestly or monumentally, from simple comprehension. Because that's what I'm here to do: comprehend. What I do with that comprehension comes later, for now it's understanding I require and there are few better suited to provide it on this particular subject than Karen Armstrong. This work has depth, intelligence, relevance, and is blissfully readable. She manages to synthesize a vast amount of intricate religious history into solid, well-constructed avenues of approach - and that is no mean feat.In , Armstrong explores the impact of modernity on the deeply religious, especially those for whom the advent of rational, scientifically-oriented thought has elicited a fear of annihilation. She tracks the course of movements in Egypt, Iran, Israel and America to maintain traditional faith in the face of the new pragmatism and the evolving insistence that what is true is only what can be empirically proven (which leaves the bedrock of most religions in the dust). She calls attention to the tendency of those who feel attacked by the modern age to retreat and isolate in their attempt to preserve their way of belief. Such isolation, fostered as it is by fear, rage and a sense of persecution, can scar the soul of a movement and bring about paranoia, desperation, thoughts of rebellion and strategies of violent retribution - which are inevitably directly opposed to the tenets such faiths hold dear.Logos and mythos, Armstrong asserts, are best when balanced. Each needs the other if the human psyche is to thrive. For while it is true that the religious need to adapt to the changing nature of civilization, it is also true that the modern world needs to recognize the vital role the spiritual holds in helping to keep the meaning (of life, struggle, suffering) in play. As she plainly points out: For those with an interest in examining the forces behind the religious extremism we are encountering today, make a note of this author and take a look at this book.

Armstrong writes eloquently and her material is well-organized and easy to understand.However, in an attempt to explain the fundamentalist mindset, Armstrong argues that \"people of the past... evolved two ways of thinking, and acquiring knowledge... mythos and logos\". She describes mythos as \"concerned with what was thought to be timeless and constant in our existence... [concerned] with meaning... [and with] the origins of life\" (p. xv). Logos, then, supposedly \"was the rational, pragmatic, and scientific thought that enabled [people] to function well in the world\" (p. xvi). The modern West, she contends, has lost mythos, preferring a future-oriented world view (logos) that prioritizes factuality and rationality. Armstrong thus constructs a happy little world in the past where both logos and mythos balanced each other perfectly (cf. p. xvii), setting up the argument that fundamentalism today is a response to the contemporary lack of mythos.Unfortunately, such a balanced world simply did not exist, and her premise is consequently undermined. For example, on p. 95, Armstrong laments the Higher Criticism assessment of the Bible as \"the triumph of the rational discourse of logos over myth\". By this time, she writes, \"Western people had lost the original sense of the mythical, and thought that doctrines and scriptural narratives were logoi, narratives that purported to be factually accurate...\" Excuse me, but what Bible is Armstrong using? My Bible certainly `purports\\' its narratives actually did happen, or that at least the writers believed so (not that I agree). Luke claims he wrote his account \"after investigating everything carefully from the very first\" (Lk. 1:3, NRSV). John includes the \"testimonials\" of a few people who swear to the factuality of the events they are recounting (cf. Jn. 19:35; 20:30-31; 21:24-25). Paul leans on the literal resurrection of Jesus to support his teachings (1 Cor. 15:14). The Old Testament cites now-lost books as if to further substantiate its account of Israel\\'s history (cf. Josh. 10:13; 2 Sam. 1:18). Thus, the narratives Armstrong considers \"mythoi\" are affirmed by their own authors as something strikingly more akin to her definition of logos. And note that the New Testament writers looked *forward* to the literal Second Coming of Jesus, clearly more in the spirit of logos. In fact, many of them broke with tradition (the past), believing something new had come and would return.Another example: Armstrong portrays the Passover Seder as a mythos meant to help Jews experience the Exodus myth and \"[bring] this strange story into their own lives... to make it their own\" (p. xvi). She asserts that \"[t]o ask whether the Exodus from Egypt took place exactly as recounted in the Bible or to demand historical and scientific evidence to prove that it is factually true is to mistake the nature and purpose of this story.\" Oh, is it now? A cursory reading of the Haggadah reveals how its authors intended the Seder to be a commemoration of an event which they believed occurred, not in mythical \"timeless realities\", but in actual history. Many other texts could be used to demonstrate how the neatly divided realms of mythos and logos did not exist. The Nicene Creed, for example, does not present a Jesus who was crucified in the eternal world of mythic truth, since its sources do not do so either. But I trust that I\\'ve made my point. In short, I *do* recommend this book for its historical information: dates, events, people, and places. But I suggest readers not take too seriously the whole mythos-logos premise as the reason for the rise of fundamentalism.',\n",
       "    'Are you confused by all the religious groups in the news? Fundamentalists, Pentecostals, Haredim, Shii, Sunni, Lubavitcher, Satmar, Wahhabis, the Muslim Brotherhood?Are you also confused by the demands of religious fundamentalists? They rant and rave and call for destruction of what seems to many Americans innocuous. Is it pure malice or something else?If you can identify with this confusion, this is the book for you! Not only is it easy to read while at the same time filled with satisfying detail, it is also three books in one, tying together the strands of Muslim, Jewish and Christian fundamentalism to show that they are all reacting to modernity in remarkably similar fashion.I\\'ve grown to appreciate Karen Armstrong from her book on Islam and her autobiography of her time in a convent, Through the Narrow Gate. She is a reliable guide through the labyrinthine world of religion, a master of pulling the underlying psychological motivation from mysterious practices.While keeping the three religious traditions distinct, yet transitioning from one to another at appropriate points where similar forces were at work upon them, Armstrong moves through history showing how each fundamentalist movement came to be in reaction to social upheaval, often almost simultaneously. I found myself repeatedly thinking, \"so THAT\\'S where that group started!\"You will hear about rabbinical thinking from the Jewish ghettos of Poland, of the high regard Iranians place on the Hidden Imam. Why was Egypt\\'s Nasser important to the formation of the Muslim Brotherhood? Armstrong powerfully illuminates what for most Americans is obscure history from other lands, yet fills us in on the history of American fundamentalism as well. Jerry Falwell, Jim and Tammy Bakker, the Scopes monkey trial, they\\'re here as well. This is an epic work that flows.Armstrong\\'s thesis is simple: being human, we need both myth (mythos) and reason (logos). While it is possible to live with only logos, to get there is not easy, not coming naturally to human beings with our psychology that all but cries out for a foundation for emotional stability. The great error is to think that mythos can be adapted to logos - that the spiritual can be explained on a rational basis, that the numinous can be made concrete. Yet reason/logos has taken the scene with overwhelming and undeniable practical success. So conclusive is this victory of logos, that mythos, to be credible to the modern mind, must be made to answer on the terms of reason - yet by its nature, it cannot.In the desperate attempt to make religion live under a scientific worldview, fundamentalism makes its appearance to rage and rant in defense of mythos on the field of logos; a project that is inevitably futile.As Armstrong explains, the coexistence of mythos and logos came naturally in the ancient world where people looked to myth for explanation and found emotional security in communicating with the spiritual, represented in religious practices of long standing. The world went on century upon century without the expectation of progress that is an essential part of modernity. Nothing was novel, all was explicable through spiritual interpretation, the will of god or the gods. St. Augustine is known for his appeal to stifle all curiosity and put faith in God.Modern secular societies look only forward in expectation of material things to come, as tradition, mythology and spirituality fall away, useless superstitions, a weakness of the credulous. Prove it or cast it off.Thus is the mythos/logos cohabitation destroyed and so arise the psychological anxieties and fears that mythos kept in check by providing answers satisfyingly endorsed by the wisdom of elders back to time immemorial.But whether it is the \"back to the Bible\" appeal or bin Laden\\'s praise for the practices of the time of Mohammed, there is no going back.Karen Armstrong would like us to ease forward with understanding rather than blind suppression. This book is a plea for understanding of the fear that drives the desperation of fundamentalism. It is not a call for the overthrow of reason or the elevation of religion, nor an apologia for religious extremism.If some Rip Van Winkle awoke and asked me for a book to understand the modern world, I\\'d hand him this one.'],\n",

       "   'Review': ['My original review of this wasn\\'t much of anything, because I believed (and still kind of do) that everything worth saying about this book has been said.However, there are things that I believe no one should say emerging in real time, and so contributing my likely already-expressed thoughts might counterbalance them, to some degree.In my first foray at writing about this (which you can still see below), I focused on the immersion of it. I said I \"loved\" its characters, though of course I meant more that I loved them as figures, considering they are unlikable murderers. I wrote about it vaguely and glowingly, thinking everyone had sort of...gotten the point of the book, already.But then I read  in Gawker, so I\\'m coming back.The Secret History follows mainly our narrator, Richard, as he looks back on his time in the classics program of a liberal arts college. Richard is unhappy, impressionable, desperate. His values are more ideas than ideals - vague and dim reflections of what love, and beauty, and wisdom, concepts he\\'s never known, might feel or look like, rather than what they are.He arrives at his preppy and prestigious(ish) New England college to slowly become obsessed and then part of the mysterious and selective classics program, a cultlike group of trust fund babies led by an often-overstepping and charismatic professor. Coming from a poor and abusive background, where beauty is nowhere to be found, Richard wants nothing more than to immerse and lose himself in this group of wealthy and charming students. He wants to befriend them, to sleep with them, to live with them, to do everything he can to  them. Including, as they indulge in ever-spiraling hedonism, murder.And it never works.When our story ends, our group is decimated, some members dead, some irrevocably changed, all unwilling to return to the story of that fateful year - all except Richard, who is unable to leave it behind.When I hear this, I don\\'t believe that the point of the story, or what Tartt is trying to tell us, is that a love of beauty is equivalent to an amoral life. I don\\'t think she condemns an appreciation for the aesthetic, or even a classical scholarship. I don\\'t think you\\'re supposed to like these characters, or even think they\\'re very realistic - they are, after all, portraits in hindsight written by someone in the throes of unrequited obsession.I don\\'t think you\\'re supposed to relate to them, or to see their story as something that might happen to you if you read too much Greek myth or like pretty things too much.To quote the article that inspired the fit of rage that has me typing away, I don\\'t think this is \"about all the things [its writer] loved,\" while \"miss[ing] the point of them entirely.\" At the age of seventeen, they continue, they \"wanted (I thought) exactly what its youthful characters wanted: a poetic life, a mythic life, a life shot through with meaning. I loved (I thought) exactly what its characters loved: nostalgic emblems of an era imagined as significant.\"To that I say: huh?As I grow older, I care less for lovely or perfect or nice or even good (in the moral definition of the word) characters, and find myself only wanting to read about the unlikable, the complex, the ones who have something to say on what I shouldn\\'t do, rather than teach me about what I should.It was clear to me that The Secret History is not the latter example, but the former.Our merry band of classics fetishists may think they are living a life of poetry and meaning, but we, the readers, know they aren\\'t. We know that life\\'s beauty lies not in pleasure without regard for others, in the fulfillment of selfish desires, but in case we get confused, Donna Tartt shows us that a life lived by those guidelines leads to irrevocably damaged relationships, unfading pain, and death.The Secret History is not a nihilistic book because its characters\\' behaviors result in no meaning. Quite the opposite - it is a book about what makes life meaningful by showing us what meaning is not.The Gawker piece quotes a Tartt essay in which she writes, “\\'Something in the spirit longs for meaning — longs to believe in a world order where nothing is purposeless, where character is more than chemistry, and people are something more than a random chaos of molecules,\\'” and in this vein concludes, \"To take Tartt the essayist seriously is to wager on that meaning. Even if that means leaving Hampden behind.\"And I would agree. To find meaning, one must leave Hampden behind - for it was never intended that what happened there should be lived by as example. (I also think there\\'s something very interesting in the class dynamics here. But I\\'ll save that for the next time I get mad enough to write almost 1,000 words.)Bottom line: Book so nice I reviewed it twice.------------this is the july pick for the !!  and i will be vibing amidst the dark academia and the gluttony and the classics. please join us!!------------I think this is a story about the destructive power of guilt. I think this is about Here is the problem with reviewing every book I read: Sometimes I throw around terms before I really need them, and then once I read THE book, The Story that requires and deserves that descriptor, I have nothing to give it.Right now I have this problem. Because I have used the word “immersive” before, and immediately upon my completion of this book it became clear that I should have saved it for right now.I felt like I lived inside these pages. I felt like I began to think in the beautiful and sharp prose that fills them. I felt like I knew the characters, ate decadent lunches and walked the snowy campus and whispered with them. I felt an aching emptiness, a genuine longing, when I read the final words.I miss living here.This was very, very slow - to the point that about halfway through I said (inexplicably, aloud), “I don’t know what they’ll even do for the rest of the book” - and yet I was gripped by it.It’s genuinely masterful.I love Richard and I LOVE Camilla and I love Francis and I, fine, okay, at least like Charles and Henry and even Bunny and Julian.And I miss them all.This is an incredible work, but maybe the most incredible thing is how the reader  Richard. I, too, miss my bygone days at my prestigious New England college with my whip-smart group of eccentric friends, and, like him, I am too quickly forced to realize the fallacy of such a feeling.After all, it was all a fiction.Bottom line: I’m raising this to a five star rating.------------you\\'ll have to excuse me, i\\'d love to actually write something here but my brain is broken and i am incapable of thought.also seems absurd to try to use words when donna tartt took all the good ones.review to come / 4.5 stars------------me: *is slightly behind on my reading challenge*also me: *starts a 600-page book*',\n",
       "    'I have never read anything like this book in my entire life. I laid in bed for over an hour last night upon finishing this book, just tossing and turning and thinking about everything I just consumed. I still don’t think I can put my feelings into words, but I can honestly say this book was a cathartic experience for me, and the irony of the word “catharsis” being a Greek rooted word is not lost on me, because if this book is anything it’s a modern day Greek tragedy.  is told in a unique style, which is a man reminiscing on some significant events that took place in his college life a bit over a year ago. So, we follow a younger version of Richard, who is finally starting his life away from his abusive and poor family in California. He gets accepted into an elite college in Vermont, and moves across the county in hopes of a fresh start. Upon arriving to the college, Richard is denied entry into an Ancient Greek course, because the professor that teaches it only allows enrollment to his small, handpicked, group of students that seem almost cult-like. Needless to say, Richard becomes utterly obsessed with the five students in this group and the professor, Julian Morrow, himself. And with a turn of good luck, and by solving a Greek problem, Richard is accepted into this exclusive group.Yet, in the prologue we find out that Richard, and four others from the group, murdered one of the other students who they are supposed to have a very close friendship with.  is then told in two parts, one being the events that took place leading up to the death of their fellow classmate, and then one part being all the events that take place after he is murdered.  is the poor soul that is unfortunately murdered by his peers, yet he’s a racist bigot and you’ll be kind of happy he’s dead, for the most part. , as stated in all the paragraphs above, is the narrator looking back on the events that took place.  is my personal favorite, but perhaps the worst of the bunch. Or maybe the best, I’m not really sure, but that’s truly the beauty of this story. Twins,  and . Charles is a bad alcoholic and drug user, and Camilla steals most people’s heart and/or affection. And lastly, we have , who owns a country home that is the stage for many events that take place in this book. Oh, and everyone but Richard has money, even though Richard tries his damnedest to keep that a secret. All the characters are morally grey to just generally horrible people, but you completely ignore it because Donna Tartt weaves this hypnotic spell with her writing, that you feel like you are reading this book in a dream like lull.  is unlike anything I’ve ever read before, and I’m not sure I’ll ever read anything quite like it again. I also want to touch upon sexuality in this book, because a lot of the members in this group are not straight in the slightest. Like, maybe the only ones that were completely straight were Bunny and Camilla. I’m not saying that the queerness in this book is vilified, but it’s for sure not shown in the best of lights. So please use caution while going into this.And this book is so very heavy in general, so please use caution while reading.  for slut shaming, use of the R word, homophobia, hate speech, fatphobic comments, racist comments, animal cruelty, sexual assault, incest, performing rituals, suicide, alcoholism, drug abuse, and murder.I know this review is probably not one of my best, and I know I’m being super vague about all these big themes, but this book is just on a whole other level. Maybe this book is about five new adults dealing with the consequences of murder in a very human and realistic way. Maybe it’s about how we are all just trying to fit in and find family, by whatever unhealthy means available and/or possible. Maybe this book is about birth and death and how important the time between those two points truly is. But I do believe with my whole heart that this book would best be experienced blind, and to just go in and feel all the feelings that Donna Tartt will serve you.While finishing the book, me and  had a discussion about the ending and how Greek heroes’ tales normally go. We talked about how murder taints everything, and how blood is the only thing that can purify it. We talked about how wearing masks is so important, yet death is another mask that we will all eventually wear. God, I’m being so cryptic, but if you’ve read the book maybe this paragraph will mean something to you, because it means the world to me. Overall, I know I sound like a broken record, but this was one of the most unique reading experiences of my life. I honest to God just do not have the words to put in this review how this book made me feel. I will say that it very much feels like a spell is being cast upon you while reading. Like, I am almost positive that Donna Tartt cannot be a human being, because she is such an exclusive enigma. Also, I think I’ve developed a huge crush on her, so there’s that at least. I can say very confidently that I will remember this book, and the feelings it gave me while reading, for the rest of my life.  |  |  |  |  |  Buddy read with ! ❤',\n",
       "    'This novel, like so many other first novels, is full of everything that the author wants to show off about herself. Like a freshman who annoys everyone with her overbearing sense of importance and unfathomable potential, Donna Tartt wrote this book as though the world couldn\\'t wait to read about all of the bottled-up personal beliefs, literary references, and colorfully apt metaphors that she had been storing up since the age of 17.The most fundamentally unlikable thing about this book is that all of the characters -- each and every one of them -- are snobby, greedy, amoral, pretentious, melodramatic, and selfish. The six main characters are all students at a small and apparently somewhat undemanding college in Vermont, studying ancient Greek with a professor who\\'s so stereotypically gay as to be a homosexual version of a black-face pantomime. In between bouts of translating Greek, the students end up murdering two people, and then devolve into incoherent, drunken, boring decay. The best thing I can equate this book to is the experience of listening to someone else\\'s dream or listening to a very drunk friend ramble on and on and on, revealing a little too much awkward personal information in the process. The climax of \\'s narrative was around page 200, but the book was 500 pages long. So, essentially, this book contained 300 pages of scenes where the characters do nothing but drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, go to the hospital for drinking so much alcohol and smoking so many cigarettes, get pulled over for drunk driving, talk about alcohol and cigarettes, do cocaine, and gossip about each other (while drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes).Tartt\\'s writing was sometimes genuinely good at establishing a thrilling and suspenseful mood, but other times, especially toward the end, her writing became the kind of self-conscious, contrived, empty prose that I can imagine someone writing just to fill out a page until a good idea comes to them, kind of like how joggers will jog in place while waiting for a traffic light. That kind of writing practice is fine...as long as the editor is smart enough to cut it before the final copy. The last 300 pages were the authorial equivalent of that kind of jogging while going nowhere, and it soured the whole book for me.In the book\\'s attempt to comment on the privilege, self-interest, and academic snobbery of rich college kids in New England, the book itself comes to be just as self-absorbed and obsessive as its characters -- it turns into a constant litany of unnecessary conversations, sexual tensions that go nowhere, purple prose descriptions of the landscape, contrived plot twists that fizzle out, and forced, overblown metaphors. The confusing part was that Tartt seemed to identify with (and expect us to identify with) these students -- not to admire them for murdering people, obviously, but to respect and envy their precious contempt for everything modern and popular, as though they lived on a higher plane than normal people. The cliche of academic types being remote from the mundane world and out of touch with reality may have a grain of truth to it, but Tartt took that cliche way too far. The story is set in the early 90s, and yet some of the characters had never heard of ATMs, and they still wrote with fountain pens, drove stick shift cars, cultivated roses in their backyards, wore suits and ties to class, and said things like, \"I say, old man!\" Did I mention that this story is set in the early 90s? It got to the point where all the anachronisms came to seem ridiculous and gratuitous. Ostensibly, the point of the novel was to critique the point of view that privileged academics are somehow superior to the average person, but Tartt seemed too enamored of her own characters and the endearing way they held cigarettes between their fingers to really allow that kind of critique to be successful. Maybe Tartt\\'s second novel managed to get away from the claustrophobic selfishness of , but I don\\'t feel up to reading it after this.',\n",
       "    'Five Things About The Secret History. This is going to be a difficult book for me to talk about. I finished it days ago but I find myself a little , I’ll admit. It’s been a long time since a book has stuck with me so completely as this one, and I say that having had a quite remarkable year for memorable reading. So, the summary is straightforward and completely unhelpful: a Californian boy arrives at a private New England college where he falls in with a bunch of snooty but delightful Classics majors who happen to have accidentally killed someone during a Bacchian rite they just happened to be conducting in their spare time. That is a totally truthful depiction of some of the events in the book, but it is not what the book is ABOUT. I will do my best to convince you to pick it up in other ways. Without further ado, here are five things about THE SECRET HISTORY.1. This is not a new book. All of your friends have already read it. You probably already have a copy of it, actually, that you picked up at some point in the last decade, and now it molders in a box in your master bedroom closet, the one that you never unpacked last time you moved. Right next to your college alarm clock and two boxes of 9-volt batteries and that shirt you can’t throw out because it was a gift. The reason why I’m pointing out that it’s not a new book is because, since reading it, I’ve been told by several people that it is their Favorite Book Ever. It is one thing for you to read a book six months before and maintain it as a Favorite Book. It is something more remarkable when a book can elicit a passionate response from readers twenty years after its publication. 2. This book is full of terrible people. Pretty much the lot of the people that our narrator Richard meets are awful in some way. Self-centered or elitist or potheads or sociopathic or just people with really loud voices in quiet places. Even Richard is not exactly a great guy. But the magic of this novel is that, somehow, you find these terrible people deeply sympathetic. I need to go back and reread it to understand this strange enchantment. How do I find them so charming? Why do I want them to like Richard? GIVE ME YOUR SECRETS, BOOK.3. This is not a whodunit. You are told pretty much the Bad Thing That Happens in the prologue, and you can see it coming like a comet for much of the book. The effect of this, however, is to create a lovely, unbearable tension and anticipation. And when the moment comes — in a line that involves ferns — it is so deliciously awful. I actually exhaled gloriously and put the book down for a moment because I was so delighted by the actual pay off. 4. It’s long. It’s over 200,000 words long, I think, and 600 pages in my edition. It took me five days to read it. And it’s not just long, it’s dense. One of the blurbs on the inside of the jacket said that it read like a 19th century novel, and I don’t think that’s at all unearned. It takes its time developing atmosphere and character quirks and some of the days in the novel take dozens of pages to unfold. It is not a novel to speed through. It’s a novel to get stuck in. I put it down when I got too tired, when I felt like I was starting to skim. 5. WHAT ELSE CAN I SAY? I adore the characters so much. I adore the hint —the breath — of the supernatural. I adore the slow, building tension and the sense that I, as a reader, was being skillfully manipulated. Yes, that. That last one. I think that is what I love the most about this novel. I get the idea that Donna Tartt was completely in control of this novel. Everything is measured and deliberate and just perfectly done, and I trust her entirely. Fifty pages in, I knew that she was going to tell me a story I was going to enjoy, even if I had no idea what it was going to be. Man, I just am going to flail about some more. Go read it. ',\n",

       "   'Summary': [\"Storytelling in the grand manner, The Secret History is a debut remarkable for its hypnotic erudition and acute psychological suspense, and for the richness of its emotions, ideas, and language. These are the confessions, years afterward, of a young man who found at a small Vermont college the life of privilege and intellect he'd long coveted - and rarely has the glorious experience of youth infatuated with knowledge and with itself been so achingly realized. Then, amazed, Richard Papen is drawn into the ultimate inner circle: five students, worldly and self-assured, selected by a charismatic classics professor to participate in the search for truth and beauty. Together they study the mysteries of ancient Greek culture and spend long weekends at an old country house, reading, boating, basking in an Indian summer that stretches late into autumn. Mesmerized by his new comrades, Richard is unaware of the crime which they have committed in his dreamy, unwitting presence. But once taken into their confidence, he and the others slowly and inevitably begin to believe in the necessity of murdering the one classmate and friend who might betray both their secret and their future. Hugely ambitious and compulsively readable, this is a chronicle of deception and complicity, of Dionysian abandon, of innocence corrupted by self-love and moral arrogance; and, finally, it is a story of guilt and responsibility. An astonishing achievement by any standard, The Secret History immediately establishes Donna Tartt as a supremely gifted novelist.\"],\n",

       "   'Review': [\"This book utterly defies categorization. It begins with a brief introduction of four girl cousins winging their way back to Pono's coffee farm in the 1990s. Then it jumps back in time and becomes historical fiction with a smattering of magical realism. Hawaii's sad and painful past is covered, with special emphasis on the way lepers were treated through the decades. But it's also a family saga following the generations of women in Pono's family, beginning with the unlikely pairing of a Tahitian princess and a one-eyed white sailor in the 1830s. Pono the dream-teller is the character holding together the entire story. She was born with mystical powers. Many people fear her the way they would a . Her life is bound by myth, legend, magic, and ancient herbal cures. Tall, fierce, and exquisitely beautiful, she has endured a life of rejection and alienation. Even her own family abandoned her as a child because they feared her strange powers. She finds solace in the sea, communing with , her shark ancestors. As she swims the depths with them she becomes part shark, growing the snout and the sandpaper-like skin. When she leaves the water she becomes fully human again. The second half of the book abandons history and returns to the 1990s. The four girl cousins have been summoned back to the Big Island by their grandmother Pono. She shares with them the secrets she should have told them many years ago when they spent their girlhood summers with her. The truth entirely alters their view of the family and their place in it. In this second half there's also a touch of romance, some thriller moments, and a strong condemnation of colonialism the world over. This portion of the book was less enjoyable reading than the first half, but the writing is masterful throughout. The scope of the novel and depth of feeling warrants a five-star rating, regardless of the disparity between the first and second halves.\",\n",
       "    'The first half of this novel is wonderful! I could not get enough of it. I thoroughly enjoyed reading about the Tahitian runaway bride and the one eyed whaler and their life in pioneer Hawaii and their children. I learned so much about Hawaii history. Davenport has exceptional talent throwing in historical facts and details without losing the magic of an engrossing storyline. I was overtaken with emotion many times. A quarter thru the book, Pono is introduced and she proves to be a character the reader will both love and hate. I found her \"becoming a shark\" a little strange and unbelievable and her behavior such as biting her daughter\\'s face extremely repulsive, but her character is so strong and brave, I was bewitched by her. The love she shares with Duke is so strong and powerful, a love that can truly endure all things. However, the story started losing me when it began focusing on Rachel, Ming, Vanya, and Jess, Pono\\'s granddaughters. I found them dull and unlikeable with all their drug and sex addictions and basically, I found myself scanning thru the last half of the book to see what became of Pono and Duke. ',\n",
       "    'Count me as one Haole Wahine who really enjoyed the lessons this book had to offer. It spanned Hawaiian history from the 1800s to present day through the eyes of several generations of strong women from one family. I\\'ve been to Hawaii a handful of times, and this book gave me perspective on why native islanders are not always quite so happy to welcome new residents from the mainland. (I\\'d heard about this from a friend who lived there, but lacked the background to understand the history behind it.) It also gave me an understanding of Hawaiian folklore, and the meaning Hawaiians give to sharks, their land, their waters, their ancestors, the role of a kahuna, and more. I even picked up quite a few words of Hawaiian. My whole perspective on Hawaii has changed now that I have such a better grasp of the history; I think I will enjoy future visits so much more from having this more through understanding of native Hawaiian culture. This book does take some commitment - it\\'s is not a beach read. There were many times when it struck me more as a James Michener \"eat your vegetables\" kind of slog. And the writing style leaves something to be desired. In my opinion, it could have done with a stronger edit. It also took me quite a while to read it. I usually try to polish off several books that relate to the place I am visiting during one trip. Despite reading quite a bit during a 10-day trip to Hawaii, I got back on the plane only 30-40% of the way through the book, and then it took me another 3 weeks to finish it. But I do feel my time was well spent here. ',\n",
       "    'A great first novel about Hawaii, with specific political views. I\\'ve seen one criticism I agree strongly with: one, the need for an editor - the copy shown in the picture looks like a galley, there are rampant spelling mistakes and run on sentences. A few times, characters travel the same routes and the drive is described almost identically twice. Someone wrote that this book could have been 100 or 150 pages shorter and would have been much \"tighter\" and I agree.That said, it\\'s a great adventure, women\\'s story (not chick lit), and it gives some real insight into Hawaii. The auther has some very good literary instincts, wrapping around the marks Agent Orange left on the skin of one generation to those that leprosy left on the prior. It made me want to read other Hawaiian authors for other views. This is a very readable, multi-generational story made special by the unique historical and cultural viewpoint.',\n",
       "    \"I liked the first 70ish pages about the matriarch Kelonikoa, the daughter of a Tahitian chief. The writing was colorful and vibrant. Hawaiian history and geogarphy were wonderfully described. But now, Pono, Kelonikoa's great granddaughter, has come on stage. The writing is just too dramatic, too graphic - with slaughter and rape and magical realism that is simply too weird. I am fighting my desire to just dump this book. I REALLY am not enjoying myself. Usch, do I have to continue with this....... I am on page 126 of 492. There is no map, and you have to constantly look up the Hawaiian words in the glossary at the back. I am going to bed. I will do anything but read this book.I forgot to mention, neither is there any humor. After sleeping on it, I have decided NOT to continue. Parts were well written, so I am giving it two stars. Frankly, maybe the book is OK, but it just isn't my cup of tea. I feel like I am a quitter, but I just don't want to read this!!!!!!!\"],\n",

It begins in the 19th century with the dramatic meeting of a young Yankee sailor and a beautiful Tahitian princess. Their descendants, who live in contemporary Hawaii, are four cousins named Vanya, Ming, Rachel, and Jess who have been brought up by Pono, a kahuna, or seer, who has never talked about her mysterious past to her four granddaughters. Davenport deftly includes much information in the narrative--about politics, leprosy, and the racial melting pot that is Hawaiian society--with a minimum of didacticism. She incorporates folklore, history, and myth in a vivid, lush prose style that only occasionally becomes overwrought. This first novel is much better written than James Michener's Hawaii (1959) and brings Hawaiian history up to the present day. \"],\n",

A priest has an affair with what appears to be a flibbertygibbit, he gets an interesting scroll in the course of his research, and then as a fallen priest he takes up with a woman who doesn't speak English but models for porn and paints on the side. In both attempts to read this I have yet to get to anything to do with the Gospel of Judas in the manner the book cover suggests, unless it is some oblique symbol of all the betrayals going on in this priest's life. And I haven't the time nor inclination to plough through this to get to it so that the light dawns on me and I understand what all this initial tedium was about. If I want to read about priests having affairs with social twits then I'd go for some bodice rippers who make no pretense about it. As for the GoJ, there were no redeeming aspects to any of the characters, which rendered absolutely no interest in their lives and therefore the book. Others may find different, I wish them well.\",\n",

       "   'Review': [\"Sister John is a Carmelite nun who, after years of dedicated service, begins to experience visions of the divine in ecstatic, crystalline clarity. But these visions are accompanied by terrible headaches, and Sister John is encouraged to seek medical attention. When told by a neurologist that her experiences are likely the result of (curable) epileptic seizures, Sister John is forced to rethink everything she knows about spiritual life.On the surface, this seems like a(nother) religion vs. science narrative. But, this isn't simply a matter of conflicting paradigms. That's the easy part. It's the human element, the choices we have to make on our own that are difficult.Sister John is genuinely good and genuinely selfless. She's so selfless and good, I very nearly abandoned the book! I couldn't relate to her. I felt Mark Salzman was keeping too much of a respectful distance. But, as the story develops, we begin to see Sister John's frailty, her human fallibility. And, yes, her . When the most meaningful experiences of her life are reduced to a neurological defect, your heart breaks for her. Salzman sees the beauty in her vocation...but he doesn't romanticize it.He's not trying to make Catholicism hip, . He's not trying to make it sexy, . He just wrote a beautiful, poignantly human narrative. And, you don't have to be Catholic to appreciate it.\",\n",
       "    \"I enjoyed this book immensely. It is the fictional story of Sister John of the Cross. Sister John is a member of a Carmelite monastery on the outskirts of Los Angeles. For many years Sister John has struggled to find true knowledge of God, her spouse, she wants to feel his presence. After waiting for such a long time for an answer she starts having headaches, along with the pain comes joy, she starts having visions, she feels that her prayers and patience have been answered. Sister John is even inspired to write a bestselling book. Whilst she is having one of her spells she sees the world differently, she sees beauty in all the small things in nature in the semi desert garden but most of all Sr. John has met the Divine.As the pains intensify it is deemed necessary by Sister John's superiors that she sees a doctor and she is faced with a life changing decision, keep her pain (and the disturbance to the lives of her sisters) or have surgery and lose her precious gift.All of Sister John's thoughts are printed in italics and you feel really a part of her struggle. Her gift has been her consolation over the last few years and also a great benefit to the monastery.This is such a peaceful story and yet it drew me into asking so many questions!If such an illness results in wonderful inspired writing is it wrong to assume that the inspiration does not come from the Holy Spirit? If it is just the illness speaking through Sister John why is it not just gobbledygook? Why are her writings so beautiful and wise? Was the gift maybe given by God to help Sister John through an impossibly hard time on her religious journey?So many ifs and buts in an inspirational story, when we learn what Sister John decides we then have to see what the outcome will be, will all be well with her and the community?\",\n",
       "    'Protagonist Sister John of the Cross is a Carmelite nun living in a convent near Los Angeles. In 1982, she has been there for thirteen years and is going through a “spiritual desert.” She then starts experiencing a vast period of creativity, writing poetry for hours at night, and publishing a book on the contemplative life. This is a period of spiritual awakening. Sister John believes these new visions and out of body sensations are a consequence of her faith. As she pours water into a bowl, This is an unusual novel that looks at the relationship between the sense of self, mind, and soul. It explores the relationship between the spiritual self and neural functioning of the brain, as she is eventually diagnosed with a neurological condition. She must then decide whether or not to treat this condition medically, and if she does, whether she risks becoming another person entirely from the person she believes herself to be. She does not want to let go of her mystical experiences, and her creative writing, which she sees as giving meaning to her life.She consults a doctor and a priest, but neither is particularly sensitive to her dilemma. It is important to note that Sister John of the Cross decided upon this name after the Spanish mystic and poet, Saint John of the Cross, author of the poem ‘‘Dark Night of the Soul.’ Sister John must navigate her own “dark night” as she decides whether or not to go down the medical path. From reading psychology, I understand that this is a very real problem for many individuals. Inner life and imagination can be released through many outside influences, including disease and neurological dysfunction. The person’s sense of the self is intimately involved, and it is difficult to separate what is internally originated versus externally imposed. They may resist being “cured.” This short novel engages readers in exploring the spiritual dimensions of the self. The author has brilliantly illustrated Sister John’s desires, doubts, fears, and internal struggles. It depicts monastic life in a much more realistic manner than some I have read recently. I do not think one needs to be a follower of religion to appreciate this book and empathize with Sister John. I found it extremely thought-provoking. I am stopping now before I write a review that is longer than the book!',\n",
       "    'Have you ever  to know God? I mean really  Him, feel close to Him, sense His presence within or near you? Sister John of the Cross, a cloistered Carmelite of middle age, waited for many dry years to know her Bridegroom. Then a few years ago she started having migraine-like headaches. With the onset of the headaches, she became able to engage in deep meditation and began having Divine encounters, which led to a best-selling book and notoriety for her convent just outside Los Angeles. However, as the severity of head pain continued to increase, Sister John was forced to seek medical attention which led to a disappointing medical diagnosis and an especially difficult decision for this theophilus, lover of God.   is a gentle, yet powerful story, more poem than prose. The book is organized around the liturgical calendar and rich in Catholic symbolism, which is why—even though it  be read quickly—it is best appreciated at leisure. In the end it is less about how she resolves her medical dilemma than what she learns spiritually, which hopefully is the case for all of us. Savor it. Better yet, take any one of Sister John’s thoughts—they are all in italics—as a rich source for your daily meditation. Excellent!',\n",
       "    'I ended up liking this book a whole lot more than I thought I was while I was reading it. In fact, when I wasn\\'t reading it, I would think about something in it that seemed to resonate with me. For example, I thought it interesting to think that \"God loves each of us as if there were no one else on earth. Believing that is the most perfect act of faith of all.\"The book is about a nun who finds out after years of feeling like she was directly experiencing God\\'s presence that she had epilepsy and that most of what she felt was due to her seizures. She has a surgery to eliminate the problem and wonders whether she should return. After all, wasn\\'t it just the epilepsy that caused her to feel so intimate with God? I particularly loved the ending. Because all the nuns admitted to doubting their decisions to devote their lives to God. But they were still there, trying. And that was the point to it all. And isn\\'t that the point to what any of us who believes in God do? It takes so much more to keep saying \"yes\" to doing things when we don\\'t have a complete faith. As Mother Emmanuel said to Sister John, \"Yet you\\'re still here, trying to do His will anyway. That\\'s the kind of understanding I meant. The doing kind, not the knowing kind.\" One other quote from the book I liked was this: \". . . no matter how many times we hear what it costs to follow Christ, we\\'re still shocked when the bill comes, and we wonder all over again if we can pay it. If we make an act of faith then, it counts more than on the days when we feel sure.\"  '],\n",

       "   'Review': ['This is the second novel I\\'ve read by Stewart O\\'Nan, after . While I enjoyed ,\" it really is a trifle compared to , which is an immensely quiet, powerful book. Essentially, it tells the story of two relationships, both disintegrating, set against the backdrop of rural Pennsylvania in the 70\\'s (my onetime hometown of Bloomington, MN makes an appearance, as does that pansy Fran Tarkenton, getting chased down by the Steelers D). In it\\'s way,  reminded me of Edith Wharton\\'s , with the small town and big secrets; the insular lives; the omnipresent snow and cold; the lonely single road that leads to Tragedy. The story is told, in part, by Arthur Parkinson, who relates the story in flashback. He tells his own story - of his parent\\'s divorce, of his first love, Lila, and his memories of Annie, his one-time babysitter who is murdered (you know this on the first page, so it\\'s not a spoiler)- in the first person. He narrates the second strand of the story, the relationship of Annie and her estranged husband Glenn, in the third-person (you know he is the narrator because, at one point, he interjects himself, to powerful effect, into the third-person strand). O\\'Nan\\'s writing is simple and direct, yet he manages, with great efficiency, to describe indelible characters. His description of the breakdown of Arthur\\'s parent\\'s marriage is spot on. I say this from experience, having seen my own parents get divorced. He eerily captures the feeling of a child torn between two warring factions in the most bitter of all conflicts: the conflict that occurs when love turns to hate (see, e.g., ). The scenes with Arthur warily dealing with his mother and father are among my favorites. The first-person narration adds to the strength of these sections. The story line with Annie and Glenn is a bit more prosaic. On the first page we learn that Annie is murdered. The rest of the novel tells you how we got to that point. Needless to say, it has to do with some of the choices she makes, choices relating to the fickle emotions emanating from our chest cavities. While believably told, it is a bit obvious. We\\'ve all read plenty of murder stories and know how we\\'re supposed to feel; it\\'s more interesting to read a detailed story about a divorce, with its emotional complexity, because even though it is far more familiar to our experience, it doesn\\'t often get explored. This is not a book with happy endings. The theme, reiterated over and over, is how we come to part from the people we love. It\\'s a subject I\\'ve spent the last year mulling. Once upon a time I was engaged to a girl I thought I\\'d see every day for the rest of my life. Now, there are times I can\\'t remember her face, or the sound of her voice, or the way she smelled (and they say smell is one of those memories that last the longest). I always wonder at that: how you go to a wedding, everyone is happy, smiling groom, blushing bride, weeping parents. Oaths before God and all that. And somehow, in some way, so many of those perfect unions are rent asunder. When it is all over, and there is nothing but ashes, you start to wonder if love is a cosmic joke that lures us with delusions of infinity, then smacks us with the reality that it\\'s as fleeting as an evening shadow. The theme is stated succinctly near the end, after Arthur\\'s father tries to reconcile with his mother, and his mother rebuffs him. She tries to explain to Arthur why she did what she did: When you are done reading it, you will probably want a hug, so it is best to read this in a room full of people who will be willing to hug you, or perhaps with a dog, though the dog will not hug you back, unless you\\'ve trained it to do so. You should also hug Stewart O\\'Nan if you see him, because I think he needs one.  ',\n",
       "    'Small towns are often portrayed as picturesque or quaint; and the inhabitants of these towns are often described as close-knit... having each other\\'s backs and being available for each other in good times and bad. In Stewart O\\'Nan\\'s novel, , he suggests that many small towns also have a darker side... harboring secrets of tragedies which no one can bear to speak of, even decades later. In this novel, the tragedy occurs in Butler, Pennsylvania. The town really exists but as far as I know, this particular tragedy never actually occurred. Butler is an old town (settled in 1803) and is situated in the rolling hills 35 miles north of Pittsburgh. The story takes place in 1974 and according to census data from that time, Butler had about 18,000 residents; and one of these residents is our narrator.. Arthur \\'Arty\\' Parkinson. The Arty who is relating the story to us is a grown man but as you will see, he feels compelled to tell the story of his childhood and describe how his coming of age came to be so intertwined with the tragic events of the winter of 1974.Although Arty is grown and has long since moved away from Pennsylvania, every year at Christmastime, he feels a pull toward his childhood home. What draws him back each year are the dual tragedies which occurred in his 14th year of life. There are two tracks to the story Arty tells... there is his own personal family tragedy playing out at the very time of the tragedy which left a scar on the entire town... the tragic death of a young woman named Annie Marchand. Annie\\'s death is not a spoiler as it happens at the very beginning of the book. The story begins with Annie\\'s death and works backward through time , revealing the circumstances which led up to that death.It was a snowy and cold early-December day in western Pennsylvania when Arty heard the gunshots which ended Annie Marchand\\'s life. Annie\\'s life had been a mess for some time. Annie, who had been separated from her husband Glenn, working as a waitress but still unable to meet her bills and having an affair with her best friend\\'s boyfriend... was living in a small house with her very young daughter Tara. The house they were living in was separated from the local high school by only the width of a small field. Arty, who was a member of the high school marching band, was outside with his bandmates practicing for the last football game of the season when the loud, sharp report of the gunfire was heard. Perhaps in a city, a person becomes somewhat accustomed to such tragedies but in a small town, where every person knows every other person, this tragedy was shocking; and to Arty, this tragedy was personal. He had a history of sorts with Annie Marchand. At one time, she had been his babysitter. She had been the \\'cool\\' older woman and he had been fascinated with everything about her... from the scent of her freshly shampooed hair to the plum color of the nail polish she wore to the way she smoked her cigarettes. What was most moving to me about this story was just how completely the town\\'s collective tragedy became so intertwined with Arty\\'s grief over his personal family tragedy. At the same time the town was mourning Annie\\'s death, Artie\\'s family was falling apart. His mother and father\\'s marriage was ending and Arty was charged with the task of choosing only his most prized possessions to take along to the efficiency apartment he would be sharing with his mother.. an apartment which could barely hold the two of them. I found it so easy to paint a mental picture of this scene... there was Arty on the cusp of manhood, caught between warring and bickering parents whom he loved but had put him in an impossible position... feeling the grief over the loss of his family, his home and the only life he had ever known and having no one with whom he could talk about this loss. Combine this loss with his confusion and grief over Annie\\'s murder... probably the first woman to have captured his imagination... and I could easily understand how it came to be that year after year, Artie was still haunted by his losses and having difficulty putting them in any kind of perspective.With \\'Snow Angels\\', Stewart O\\' Nan has written a hauntingly beautiful story of loss and grief and how it feels to be a boy on the verge of becoming a man and experiencing the first great losses among what might be a life full of losses.. large and small. I admit that I search for novels written by Mr. O\\'Nan because he has set many of them in Pennsylvania and I find those stories comforting... not having to IMAGINE those settings but instinctively KNOWING them as intimately as I know the rooms of my own home. In this novel, Mr. O\\'Nan masterfully used this western Pennsylvania setting to evoke the feelings of desolation, loss and grief.... there is nothing I know of that can evoke those feelings better than the cold and grey wintry Pennsylvania landscape. And Arty... with his down jacket, tasseled Pittsburgh Steeler hat and his \"shitkicker\" boots, hunched over against the cold, icy wind.. well, he could have been a boy from my own childhood. \\'Snow Angels\\' was Stewart O\\'Nan\\'s outstanding debut novel but it sure wasn\\'t his last!',\n",
       "    '“All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” ― , It is 1974 in Butler, Pennsylvania. Arthur is fourteen. His older sister, Astrid is in military service, flying high over Russia, photographing bits and pieces of a very cold country in a very cold war. But the real war is back in Butler, on the home front.Arthur\\'s mother and father are splitting up. His mother explains to him that she loved another man and his father could not forgive her. She adds that she was not the villainess, Arty\\'s father had his own women on the side.At the same time, Annie Marchand, the perfect babysitter who had watched Arthur and Astrid while their parents lived out the motions of happiness in a marriage, has problems of her own. Life hasn\\'t turned out well for the pretty babysitter, now grown, married, and the mother of a beautiful little girl, Tara.Annie\\'s problem is her husband Glenn. He\\'s not a bad sort. In fact, he\\'s so damned nice. He\\'s the excited puppy, bouncing from job to job that he can never keep. No matter how good his intentions, Glenn finds reasons to be late for work. Too much booze. Too little interest. Another job hunt. Annie soldiers on as the family breadwinner, a waitress at the club, overlooking the golf course.It is a cold winter afternoon. Mr. Chervinick has the band practicing out on the soccer field, preparing for the last half-time show of the football season. Arthur, in the trombone line, a highschool freshman, numbly marches through the drill routine, obliques and a whirlwind maneuver that Chervinick calls the tornado, a movement the band never can perform to their director\\'s satisfaction.As Jimmy Buffet sings, \"There ain\\'t to reason to hurricane season.\" A tornado is something that can\\'t be controlled, nor can a high school band replicate its movements on a practice field.During their attempt to swirl and twirl across the practice field, gunshots ring out. This is where our story begins.From that point on, O\\'Nan deftly weaves the stories of Arthur and Annie\\'s families. There is a terrible beauty in the symmetry of the death of two marriages. After stormy screaming matches between his mother and father, Arthur\\'s family dissolves in a whimper. Annie\\'s ends in those gunshots that reverberate over the practice field.Moving between the voices of Arthur, Annie, her bad boy lover, Brock, and husband Glenn, slowly spiralling into madness,  sings with the power of a Greek chorus in building to an unavoidably tragic conclusion.While O\\'Nan weaves all the strands of a spider\\'s intricate web of emotion, interspersed are moments of dark humor as Arthur suffers the consequences of his parents\\' divorce. No longer able to sustain two homes equivalent to their former household, Arthur finds himself living in the most efficient of efficiency apartments, a former retreat for ministers, now converted into family apartments. The chapel has been demolished, but its foundation stands as a reminder of its former role. It is a place Arthur and his bus mates laughed at on their way to school. It is the home of twin sisters Lily and Lila, also the butt of Arthur and his friends crude humor. Now Arthur waits for the bus with Lily and Lila, slowly finding himself attracted to Lila. He wonders what she would look like without her glasses and what her body might be like underneath the home sewn clothes she wears.We follow Arthur through obtaining his learner\\'s permit, his father\\'s sporadic and awkward weekend visits. Arthur\\'s father teaches him to drive in a battered car belonging to his paternal aunt. His mother, also a waitress, as is Annie, has kept the family Country Squire, the quintessential automotive image of the perfect family\\'s perfect automobile, a reminder of family vacations during happier days. These days cannot be recreated. They can only be remembered.Astrid appears as a distant voice on telephone calls from Germany. She is removed from the cold war at home. Although she asks Arthur if he would like her to take leave and come home as he doesn\\'t seem to be taking care of their mother, clearly she has no intention of doing so. Arthur takes satisfaction in knowing where her secret stash of weed is, the pipes, the bongs, the papers. That will show her.We watch as Arthur sets out on his trek to adulthood, desperately trying to arrive there in the arms of Lila. She\\'s very nice without her glasses on. And, oh God, the bra is off. Oh, God, what is beneath that awful binding garment is beyond Arthur\\'s wildest dreams. And the wheels on the bus go round and round. What a reminiscence--the opening of the old television show, \"Ben Casey.\" Perhaps you remember it. \"Man. Woman. Birth. Death. Infinity.\"  That\\'s O\\'Nan\\'s marvelous novel in a nutshell. Snow angels. I\\'ve made them as a child. I\\'ve watched my children make them. Giddy moments of the exhilaration of being a child and alive. In this novel, snow angels are not symbols of happiness but the bleak harbingers of unhappiness and a tornado of death and violence that will forever haunt the reader.Yes, each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. This novel almost makes you wonder if there is such a thing as reincarnation.Born in 1961, Stewart O\\'Nan took his MFA from Cornell in 1992. His short story collection, , was awarded the Druse Heinz in 1993. His manuscript of  captured the first Pirate\\'s Alley Faulkner Prize for the Novel, awarded by the Pirate\\'s Alley Faulkner Society of New Orleans in 1993. The novel was published in January, 1994. O\\'Nan\\'s latest novel is , out January, 2012. I\\'ll have Mr. O\\'Nan sign that at the Alabama Booksmith in Homewood, Alabama on January 23, this week, when I\\'ll also respectfully ask him to sign my copy of this novel and his award winning collection of short fiction, .',\n",
       "    \"It really equates to a 4 star in the writing and the balance of the duo marriage stories. But my enjoyment of it was below 3. O'Nan writes actual common folks at a 5 star level, consistently. I love his work much more when he also meanders into whimsy and minutia of era and place, and never as much when he hits his deepest notes of tragedy. This is prime tragedy. Recognizing all of these individuals, there were few that caught my concern- and none that grabbed my affection. Flawed, flawed people making circular decisions in ever downward spirals. Life reflected for sure. Very depressing to read for me. I wanted to grab Annie by her hair to yank her out of her mindlessness and cruelty cocoon into some measure of semi-adult self-identity. Weak and selfish people with lack of sensibility to moral values or emotionally sound focus dominate this novel. They're all predominantly reactive and most rudderless to knowledge of their own purpose. To such an extent that I could not get embedded in their eventual outcomes, so it was a 2.5 in enjoyment for the read. \",\n",
       "    'After reading , I became a fan of Stewart O\\'Nan and knew that I would be reading more from him.  is the first novel O\\'Nan wrote, and my second read from this author. The story is narrated by Arthur Parkinson, who was 14 years old during the winter of 1974 and living in the small town of Butler, Pennsylvania. This is the winter that his parents separate and his family falls apart. He and his mom move into a run-down little apartment, his dad is dating someone new, his mom is angry and depressed and coming undone, and Arthur\\'s sister Astrid is calling from her station in Germany every so often to blame Arthur for not doing more to \"fix\" the situation. Simultaneously, we learn the story of Annie Marchand, Arthur\\'s childhood babysitter, who is down on her luck with things continuously getting worse. The parallel storylines lead up to the event of her murder one cold snowy evening while Arthur is at band practice and everyone hears the gunshot.The only reason I\\'m giving this one 4 stars instead of 5 is because I got confused with the timeline early on. I eventually figured it out, but it made everything feel a bit disjointed in the beginning. Basically, Arthur is now an adult and is looking back on what happened during the winter of 74, as he and Astrid are visiting their old hometown for Christmas. This is stated in Ch.1, and then Ch.2 begins in October of 74 and switches perspectives between Arthur, Annie, and a few people connected to Annie as things lead up to her murder. I didn\\'t really feel this was quite clear enough in the beginning; but then again, I may have been half-asleep when I began the book.ETA: I\\'m changing my rating to 5 stars, because the story has remained with me all day after finishing the book. The story really sucks you in and gives you a great understanding of why the characters are the way that they are. The setting is fantastically described, and the snowy weather is as gray as the characters\\' circumstances. It\\'s not a feel-good book by any means, but it is complex and meaningful and realistic. **I just realized this was made into a movie in 2007, starring Kate Beckinsale. Can\\'t wait to watch it!**'],\n",

On a snowy winter afternoon, the winter of his parents' breakup, Arthur Parkinson's high school band practice is interrupted by the sound of gunshots. Too close for deer hunting, it is the sound of the murder of Annie Marchand. Once Arthur's babysitter, and the object of his childhood admiration, Annie is a young woman for whom life didn't turn out quite right, who could find no one to blame, and who could not keep herself, or her loved ones, from harm. With exquisite feeling and perfect pitch, Snow Angels weaves together two haunting stories: Arthur's account of how his family fell apart and everything went wrong the year he turned fifteen, and the shifting-focus story of Annie Marchand and the broken life she cannot seem to reassemble - a story that will draw Arthur into its deepening eddy as it nears an inevitable conclusion.\"],\n",

       "   'Review': ['This short book discusses the call of God to ministry and how to discern it. It would be easy for a book like this to overpromise by providing \"10 easy steps\" or \"5 quick ways.\" Thankfully, it avoids this. Over and over, statements about how to recognize the call of God are qualified with caveats and cautions, to the point where I was left wondering if there\\'s really  way to discern such a subjective thing. No doubt this is why the authors advocate so strongly for a community approach, something that might sound odd to an American religion that embraces individualism –but which is more in keeping with the tradition of the church. Well worth reading if you\\'re struggling with whether God is calling you to ministry, ordained or otherwise.',\n",
       "    'Listening Hearts describes a way of thinking about and making major life choices. Written by a Quaker, the book outlines how to gather a group of like-minded people and conduct sessions consisting of question-asking, prayer, and (lots of) silence. The idea is to sense what the Spirit is already doing in the life of the person making a decision, and discerning together where She might be calling the discerner next. I thought it was an intriguing process-- I appreciated a lot of the values behind it (silence, community, attentiveness), and would love to try it out some time. ',\n",
       "    '“Live the questions,” urges Rainer Maria Rilke. I have spent the past four years studying theology in preparation to enter the Diaconate of the Episcopal Church. My journey will continue with the discernment process. This will be a year, or more, of questioning and discussion. This thin, but powerful volume, outlines the deep questions and reflection that help focus on true calling. Prayers, scripture, and prose are offered throughout. This is likely a book I will be rereading throughout this year.',\n",

In both attempts to read this I have yet to get to anything to do with the Gospel of Judas in the manner the book cover suggests, unless it is some oblique symbol of all the betrayals going on in this priest's life. And I haven't the time nor inclination to plough through this to get to it so that the light dawns on me and I understand what all this initial tedium was about. If I want to read about priests having affairs with social twits then I'd go for some bodice rippers who make no pretense about it. As for the GoJ, there were no redeeming aspects to any of the characters, which rendered absolutely no interest in their lives and therefore the book.

       "   'Review': ['Four and a half stars.This novel takes an issue which people usually have very definite views about and turns it into a highly readable story. The main characters are Mary Ann Tierney who is fifteen and pregnant. For reasons that become clear as the book moves forward, Mary Ann wants a partial birth abortion. Opposing her desire for this are her parents, who are outspoken advocates against abortion under any circumstances. The situation ends up as a court battle, with Mary Ann and her lawyer Sarah against Mary Ann’s parents. Into the mix add the newly appointed president Kerry Kilcannon and his candidate for Chief Justice, Caroline Masters plus senators from the opposing political party and particularly Senator Chad Palmer. Each of these three have dangerous secrets in their past. This story highlights the way politicians and their families lives are delved into, to expose their deepest secrets, regardless of the hurt to any concerned. And there is plenty of that.The characters are complex and well-drawn. They show people of principle and also those who will use whatever means at their disposal, even if it has disastrous consequences to undermine another person. And it is not only the guilty who suffer and pay the price. I found this a riveting though not a quick read. One reason it was not a quick read is it is a hefty book and the issues need to be carefully considered. Sometimes the description of events are graphic and I had to put the book down for a book. But then I also had to pick it back up again. The f word is peppered throughout and I admit to not always understanding exactly how the American political system works. Those points aside, this is a book worth reading. It is a book that will make you think. Will it change your opinion on issues? Maybe or maybe not. But it will cause you to think about them in depth. I recommend giving this book a read.',\n",
       "    \"If this work is characteristic, Patterson writes very literate mystery/thriller novels that take a public issue and dissect it from multiple viewpoints. Protect and Defend has been described by one reviewer as the most accurate portrayal of the Washington political scene. The issue is abortion, specifically fifteen year- ld Mary Anne Tierney’s struggle to abort late-term a severely hydrocephalic, brainless, and otherwise deformed and defective fetus. A normal birth has been deemed impossible and she worries that a Caesarian, as often happens, will prevent her being able to have children later. Her family are vigorously antiabortion under any circumstance Her father is a brilliant law professor and he is pitted against her in the courtroom as the legal representative of the unborn child. A subplot is the political struggle to have a new chief justice confirmed. The recently elected president, Kerry Kilcannon, introduced in a previous book of Patterson’s, , chooses to nominate Caroline Masters (Patterson’s ). There are allusions to events that take place in both of these earlier works, neither of which I have read — the stack grows ever skyward. Kilcannon and Masters are both very strong, principled characters, who, nevertheless, have skeletons in the closet that provide a most interesting backdrop for an examination of ethical dilemmas. The centerpiece is the sensational, nationally televised trial that pits Mary Anne against her family and becomes an issue in the Masters nomination. Mary Anne’s attorney is a young lawyer who wants to overturn a recently passed law that requires parental consent for abortions. Patterson excels at presenting all sides of an issue quite objectively, and it’s often difficult not to sympathize with all the parties in this difficult case. Patterson’s an attorney who knows the law, and his novel reflects considerable research. The book could almost be a primer on abortion law and how it has evolved uniquely in this country — it’s hardly an issue in most other countries. It’s also a lesson in how politics is conducted. He talked with both Clinton and Senator Dole about how they would promote or try to defeat a Supreme Court nominee, and he relates that the strategies he learned from these two politically astute people were mesmerizing.  Clearly, Patterson understands the different threads of belief that go into making the conflict so bitter in this country: the patriarchal strain in fundamentalist religion that suggests that women must play a secondary role in the home, making reproduction a male prerogative; a negative cultural response to the perceived licentiousness of the much maligned sixties; and the genuine and respectable view against abortion that relates to the devaluation of life. A difficulty has been for the pro-life movement to define death. According to Patterson, they have been unable to resolve the distinction between biological death and brain death. The Pope, ironically, has accepted brain death as a sign that life is gone, but he has been unable to accept that no brain, i.e., no cerebral cortex formation may be the same thing. For an excellent discussion of the distinction between life and being a human being, I recommend  Patterson deliberately chose to write about a partial-birth abortion because he felt the moral and ethical issues can be brought more clearly into focus. He noted in a television interview on C-Span-2 that “partial-birth” is not a medical concept. It’s a political term that has been used to redefine what abortion means. The book also deals with the relationships within families. “People project their own supposed loveliness as parents on the world at large, and their reaction is terribly personal: ‘I’m a good parent and I would want to be involved,” What they don't stop to consider is that first, if they’re in a functioning family, chances are really good their daughter isn't going to require an Act of Congress to talk to them about this. Second, we may be lovely parents, but what about incestuous families, abusive families, alcoholic families, families where the kid is used as a bone of contention between parents who are at war? All sorts of things which mean that in a given case, you’re either going to get a delay or perhaps a baby out of it, because the minor ultimately doesn’t know what to do. Or, in the worst case, death, either from illegal abortion or because of some act of family violence which is triggered by the exposure of the father’s sexual abuse of the daughter.” This is a fascinating book.\",\n",
       "    \"I read this book back in 2004. The subject is partial-birth abortion and it does a great job of bringing the point-of-view from all sides -- and no side is looked at frivilously. Because of this, I changed my view on the subject -- a very rare feat for a work of fiction to accomplish. The main characters (the ones you'll care about) are well thought out and the plot always moves forward, but by the end, it's all boiled down to the main point: Who gets to decide. I highly recommend it.\",\n",
       "    \"My mom bought me this book because she taught it had an interesting name (that was almost two years ago) so i decided to pick it up because she always asked if i had read the book jajajajaja. I love her.Anywaysssss i just realized that this book was the second book in a trilogy jajajajaja.The plot was interesting and original. I really like how everything in the USA goverment was shown (or at least I think was shown, because I obviously don't know a thing about it) how everthing works: the laws, the president, the senators, the money, the influences, you know what I mean.I don't have that much to say because the plot was about abortion and even though i support the thing i dont know much about it and i dont want to upset anyone who actually does know about it by saying something stupid. i think everyone should read this book, it makes you think in what's really wrong with several subjects. (sorry for my english, i'm not as good as i'd like but i'm trying to improve it everyday)\",\n",
       "    'I really enjoy books by Richard North Patterson - interesting discussions on issues that I think about in the context of a beach/plane read. Long enough that there is room to present some of the details about the process/issue under discussion; simplistic characters so that I can pay attention to the issues and not have too many details to keep track of and enough of a story to keep me interested. Protect and Defend discusses two issues - late term abortions and confirmation of supreme court justices and some of the things (lobbying, press, differing priorities) that make resolution of these issues even more difficult.

       "   'Review': ['I first read  when I was thirteen years old. It was the first of Dickens\\' works that I\\'d read of my own volition, the only other being , which we\\'d studied parts of in school. You know, I missed out on a lot when I was thirteen. By this, I mean that I didn\\'t always understand the deeper meaning lying beneath the surface of my favourite classics. I favoured fast-paced and gritty stories and didn\\'t understand the love for Austen (later cured). But there was something about  that hit me hard on all levels and there was a deeper understanding I took from it even back then.I should say first of all, this book makes me feel sad. Not a Lifetime movie emotionally overwrought pass-me-the-kleenex kind of sad. I have read it several times and have never once cried while reading it. But the book never fails to leave me with this . When I was a kid, I often wished I could jump inside the TV and warn the good guys not to do something; stop something horrible from happening. This is that kind of book for me. All the not-knowing and mistaken assumptions that float between the characters in this novel is torture.Some readers don\\'t like Dickens. He\\'s been called \"lacking in style\", as well as a bunch of other things. Well, I think he\\'s like the Stephen King of the Victorian era. He loves his drama, his characters are well-drawn but sometimes edging towards caricatures, he has a wonderful talent for painting a vivid picture of a scene in your mind but a bunch of his books are a hundred pages too long. Whatever. I love his stories. And I love his characters.In , you have the orphaned Philip \"Pip\" Pirrip who has spent his short life being poor and being bullied by his sister who is also his guardian. You have Joe Gargery, a kind man who also allows himself to be bullied by Pip\\'s sister (his wife). Then you have the infamous Miss Havisham who was abandoned at the altar and now spends her days wandering around her mansion in her old wedding dress, hating men and raising the young Estella to be just like her.At its heart, this is a book about someone who is given an opportunity to have all their dreams come true, to be better than they ever thought they could be, to be loved by someone who they never thought would look at them. We all yearn for something badly at times. Imagine having the chance to get exactly what you always wanted. Imagine becoming better and higher than you knew was possible. Imagine having all of that and then realizing that perhaps the most important thing you ever had got left behind.Pip was always my favourite Dickens protagonist because he wants so much and I sympathise with him. I can understand why he does what he does and why he wants what he wants. But the saddest thing is that ambition can make you lose sight of other important things and Pip has a lot of hard lessons to learn along the way. It\\'s a book that was extremely relevant to the times when social class was of utmost importance in Britain. Essentially, the book deconstructs what it means to be a \"gentlemen\" and makes a not-so-subtle criticism of a class-based society.Who are the real gentlemen? The top hat wearing men of London with all their fine china and ceremony? Pip, who gets a chance to become one of them? Or Joe Gargery, the rough-talking blacksmith who even years later tells Pip: \"you and me was ever friends\"? There is a powerful lesson in here and I love it. Even after all these years. |  |  |  ',\n",
       "    'My students (and some of my friends) can\\'t ever figure out why I love this novel so much. I explain how the characters are thoroughly original and yet timeless, how the symbolism is rich and tasty, and how the narrative itself is juicy and chock-full of complexity, but they just shake their heads at me in utter amazement and say, \"What\\'s wrong with you, dude?\"What\\'s wrong, indeed.I give them ten or fifteen years. Perhaps they\\'ll have to read it again in college, or maybe they\\'ll just try reading it again as an adult to see if they can try to figure out why it\\'s such a \"classic,\" but after some time has passed from their initial encounter with the novel, they will find that I am not so crazy after all and that the book is in fact one of the best examples--if not  best example--of the novel. This happens to me all the time: I will re-read something I was forced to read in middle school and high school, remembering how much I hated it then, and will find that I actually love it now, as an adult. Sure, those \"classics\" may have taught me something about literary analysis, symbolic patterns, and the like, but I couldn\\'t appreciate it for its complexity until I was older. I guess the rule of wine appreciation applies here, too: good taste only comes after much patience and experience.***Perhaps the thing I love best about this novel is the cast of characters--their names as well as their personalities. Ms. Havisham is one of my favorite characters to ever appear in all of the literature I have read. There is so much density and complexion to her character that I could literally make an entire career out of writing discourses on her characterization. She has even invaded the way I think about the world and the people I have met: I have, for instance, started referring to those instances where parents try to achieve success through their children \"the Havisham effect\" (unfortunately, you see this all too often in the world of teaching). Havisham\\'s name is another exasperatingly fantastic aspect of her character: like the majority of Dickens\\' characters, you pretty much know what you\\'re in for when you first read her name--she is full of lies, tricks, and deceits (or \"sham\"s). You don\\'t get this sort of characterization much of anywhere else in the literary scene.Another reason I love this novel so much is its plotting. Remember, Dickens was writing in a serialized format so he needed to keep his readers hooked so that they\\'d want to buy the next issue of his periodical, , in order to see what happens next. Thus, the plot of  is winding, unpredictable, and quite shocking at points. Certainly, in terms of heavy action--well, what our youngsters these days would call action, fighting and big explosions and what-not--there is none, or very little at most, but that\\'s not the thing to be looking for. Figure out the characters first, and then, once you\\'ve gotten to know and even care for them (or hate them), you will be hooked on the plot because you will want to know what happens to these people who you\\'ve invested so much feeling into. This is, of course, true of all novels, but it\\'s what I tell my students when they read  for the first time, and by gum, it\\'s helped more than a few of them get through the novel successfully.So, if you read  in middle school, high school, or college, but haven\\'t picked it up since, I urge you to do so. With a more patient and experienced set of eyes, you just might surprise yourself.',\n",
       "    'welcome to...GREAT EXPECTA(JUNE)S. that was so bad. i need to write fast - i\\'m expecting a SWAT team to enter my cute apartment via my lovely floor-to-ceiling windows and put me out of my misery at any moment. you can\\'t murder the art of punning like that and expect to escape with your life.in the meantime. welcome back to the  in which me and  read a long classic over the course of the month, because we are otherwise too cowardly!this book in particular has been haunting me. maybe if my expectations were so great i\\'d have actually read it, instead of having it on my tbr for over 5 years!! ha ha...ha...ha.oh lord.we\\'re also reading this for our book club -join the discussion follow on instagram let\\'s get into it.no wonder this lil orphan\\'s existence is so miserable. his name is philip pirrip. that\\'s a recipe for disaster if i\\'ve ever heard one.i have been putting this book off for approx 10 years (my mom bought me a copy, for some reason, in my youth), but it is immediately more readable than i thought.not exactly surprising. this is coming from the girl who bought little house on the prairie at the age of 8 at the scholastic book fair, took one look at the old timey prose, and chucked it in the (literal) back of my closet with a post-it note saying DON\\'T READ UNTIL YOU\\'RE 10.charles dickens is funnier than 90% of netflix\\'s most recent standup releases. and i like standup.IT\\'S THE ROMAN NOSES PASSAGE THAT THE DAD READS TO DOMHNALL GLEESON IN ABOUT TIME!!!!!!!!! suddenly this whole thing is a mental bill nighy audiobook for me. what a treat.incredibly small section today. it\\'s like charles dickens knew that centuries in the future, a very hungover girl would be attempting the fifth and sixth chapters, and took mercy.miss havisham AND estella!! even i have heard of these heavy hitters. this is a star-studded book. damn good line. i just realized that roughly 70% of the preconceived notions i had about this book are actually about oliver twist. oops. this reads like a viral tweet. so many wasted years not reading this book because i thought the language would be intimidating, when actually it\\'s 99% memes.estella is my favorite character, easy. i am so obsessed with mean girls. i\\'ve told this story before, but i have an ex-boyfriend who was once in a fight with one of his roommates, who was very rude, and i was talking him up and on his side every moment up to and including when i met her, and then forever after i wanted her to like me more than anything.i would forsake pip, joe, the neighborly gang, the sister, and the convicts for estella in a heartbeat. not havisham, though. i love that creepy ghoul too.there is nothing a classic author likes more than the idea of Being Hit Hard On The Head Changing Your Personality. it seems like a huge indulgence to them specifically that there\\'s any scientific backing to that at all.title mention title mention title mention!!!how fun. go pip.as long as there have been books there\\'s been this annoying Kid Starts Out With Nothing Then Gets Something And Immediately Sucks character arc.return of the pale young gentleman!!! love a surprise reappearance from a fan favorite.i typically HATE cannot STAND and generally ABHOR flashbacks and backstories of any kind, but dickens is so funny and i like these characters so much that i\\'m having a damn blast. what is going on!!really feeling like those who read austen for the humor would really like this book.........one of those I Am Not Into This Right Now But Maybe It\\'s Not You It\\'s Me Or Something days.if you told me before today that a paragraph mainly about being a blacksmith would be enough to bring a tear to my eye i would have laughed in your damn face. but i am a joe loyalist to the core. unless he\\'s ever pitted against estella.i just love her more and more every time we encounter her.single most entertaining-sounding production of hamlet of all time appears to be depicted in these pages.but then, i\\'m no hamlet stan. too much whining.when charles dickens said  and sally rooney said never doubt my ability to tie absolutely everything in to sally. has gotta be one of the great parenthetical insertions.this is boring today. and the chapters are long. i\\'m whiny about it.oof, AND i have to deal with ??? GIVEN???not our finest day.it was fun to see estella yelling at havisham, though.you have to love this book for its dedication to hosting the Return of a Fan Favorite. basically the entire thing is about introducing a character, sending him away, cracking jokes for 80 pages, and bringing him on back.AND WHAT A RETURN IT IS! holy moley.my first thought, of COURSE, is how this impacts estella. and the answer: to me, rad.and on to part 3!i guess the phrase \"beggars can\\'t be choosers\" had not yet originated when this was published. in 100 bce or whatever.i am so thoroughly Team Pip Does Not Automatically Deserve Estella Just Because He Thought He Was Entitled, And Also No One Does that i keep forgetting about the no one does part and just getting mad at pip.he did make a good ass speech to her, though. that i can admit.today in  i learned that charles dickens once took a 7 hour walk through london overnight because he got in a fight with his wife, in an instance i am forced to call \"the first ever hot girl walk.\"i can\\'t help thinking i would have picked this up ages ago had i only known that dickens was a drama queen.the world is just goddamn awful today so i guess my \"escapist reading\" will be about when everyone was a weird little gutter rat in england.i\\'m going to be honest. i have almost no clue what\\'s going on here.as jpuzzle in  said, WHY DOES EVERYONE KNOW EACH OTHER.finding ms havisham super relatable. i too find the only way to respond to seeing the consequences of my own actions is by setting myself on fire.THIS BOOK IS SO CRAZY!!!took a day off right at crunch time and baby, i will not be catching up today!! pray for short chapters for me, my brethren.and so it shall be!!!also will not be catching up today. i have forgotten how to read. (it went away with my bodily autonomy and human rights! buh dum ch.)did charles dickens have a ration on how many characters he could use? everyone is pulling triple duty at this point.  i have that quote framed!anyway, our short-chapter-day luck has run out, my friends.ok. have to catch up today. running out of time.the drama of it all!!honestly rude for chapters to be long on a catch-up day. but i am strong and full of life and i will finish!!!ok...this is everything. the real love stories here are pip and joe and pip and herbert. brings a tear to mine eye. last chapter time!bye, estella!! all my love!this whole thing was suuuuch a pleasant surprise: more readable, more amusing, and more interesting than i thought. i got bogged down in the middle (and i preferred the alternate / sadder / more realistic ending, when i sought it out) but in the end, cool fun yay!',\n",
       "    'I hadn’t ever met Miss Havisham officially, although I knew of her. I have heard of her circumstances, discussed her in English Literature classes, and even referenced her in a paper. She is a tragic figure tinged with true insanity; and yet, someone in complete control of her faculties when it comes to talking about HER money. She was jilted at the altar and like a figure from mythology she is suspended in time. She wears her tattered wedding dress every day and sits among the decaying ruins of her wedding feast. We meet our hero Pip when in an act of charity born more of fear than goodwill he provides assistance to a self-liberated convict named Abel Magwitch. It was a rather imprudent thing to do similar to one of us picking up a hitchhiker in an orange jumpsuit just after passing a sign that says  Little does he know, but this act of kindness will have a long term impact on his life. Pip is being raised by his sister, an unhappy woman who expresses her misery with harsh words and vigorous smacks.  She also browbeats her burly blacksmith husband Joe into submission. Mr Pumblechook, Joe’s Uncle, is always praising the sister for doing her proper duty by Pip.  In other words she didn’t spare the rod or the child. Mr. Pumblechook is one of those annoying people who is always trying to gain credit for anyone’s good fortune. He intimates that he was the puppet master pulling the strings that allowed that good fortune to find a proper home. Later when Pip finds himself elevated to gentleman’s status Pumblechook is quick to try and garner credit for brokering the deal. Things become interesting for Pip when is asked to be a play companion of Miss Havisham’s adopted daughter Estella. The girl is being trained to be the architect of Miss Havisham’s revenge...on all men. She is the brutal combination of spoiled, beautiful, and heartless. She wants Pip to fall in love with her to provide a training ground for exactly how to keep a man in love with her and at the same time treat him with the proper amount of disdain. As Pip becomes more ensnared in Estella’s beauty Miss Havisham is spurring him on. Pip is fully aware of the dangers of falling in love with Estella, but it is almost impossible to control the heart when it begins to beat faster.  His hopes, almost completely dashed that he will ever have a legitimate opportunity to woo Estella properly are buoyed by the knowledge of a benefactor willing to finance his rise to gentleman status. No chance suddenly becomes a slim chance. Pip is not to know where these  are coming from, but he assumes it is Miss Havisham as part of her demented plans for exacting revenge by using Estella to break his heart. He is willing to be the patsy for her plans because some part of him believes he can turn the tide of Estella’s heart if he can find one beating in her chest. The book is of course filled with Dickensonian descriptions of the bleaker side of Victorian society. As I was reading the book it felt like the plot suddenly sped up from a leisurely world building pace that permeates most Dickens novels to the final laps of an Indy 500 race. I was not surprised to discover that Dickens had intended this novel to be twice as long, but due to contractual obligations with the serialization of the novel Dickens found himself in a quandary. He had a much larger story percolating in his head, but simply out of room to print it. Nothing drives a reader crazier than knowing that this larger concept was realized, but never committed to paper. Pip is a willing victim; and therefore, not a victim because he fully realized that Miss Havisham was barking mad, and that Estella had been brainwashed into being a sword of vengeance. He was willing to risk having his heart wrenched from his body and dashed into the sea for a chance that Estella would recognize that happiness could be obtained if she would only forsake her training. Pip like most young men of means spent more than his stipend allowed and as debts mount he is more and more anxious to learn of his benefactor’s intentions. It will not be what he expects and provides a nice twist to the novel. There are blackguards, adventures, near death experiences, swindlers, agitations both real and imagined, and descriptions that make the reader savor the immersion in the black soot and blacker hearts of Victorian society. Better late than never, but I now have more than a nodding acquaintance with Miss Havisham, Pip, and the supporting cast. They will continue to live in my imagination for the rest of my life.If you wish to see more of my most recent book and movie reviews, visit I also have a Facebook blogger page at:',\n",
       "    \"That is such a quote. If there was ever a novel that shows us the dangers of false perceptions then it’s . Pip is such a fool; he constantly misjudges those around him, and he constantly misjudges his own worth. This has lead him down a road of misery because the person who held the highest expectations for Pip was Pip himself. But, in spite of this, Pip does learn the error of his ways and becomes a much better person, though not before hurting those that have the most loyalty to him.   The money Pip received clouds his vison completely. He, in his innocence, longed to be a gentleman, but when he has the chance he forgets everything thing he is. In his self-imposed aggrandisement he can only deduce that his money came from a source of respectability; his limited capacity has determined that only he, a gentleman, could receive money from a worthy source. But, what he perceives as respectable is the problem. Indeed, Dickens contrasts societies’ gentleman (created through social station) with the true gentleman of the age who may, or may not, have any money. Pip has falsely perceived that to be a gentleman one must have money, and must have the social graces that comes with it. However, this is far from the truth as Pip later learns. He thinks Joe is backward and ungentlemanly, but Joe, in reality, is more of a gentle man than Pip could ever be. In this, he has forgotten his routes and his honest, if somewhat rough, upbringing. He has been tainted by money and the rise in class that came with it. I think if he never received the allowance he would have eventually been happy at the forge. He may have sulked for a year or two, but, ultimately, he would have got over himself as he does eventually do. The money gave him hope; it gave him a route in which he could seek his Estella. Without the money he would have realised she was, in fact, unobtainable regardless of his class; he would have moved on and got on with his life. But, that wouldn’t have made for a very interesting novel.Indeed, Pip wouldn’t have learnt a thing. Through the correcting of his perceptions he learns the value of loyalty and simple human kindness. This changes him and he is, essentially, a much better person for it. He learns the errors of his ways, and how shameful and condescending his behaviour has been to those that hold him most dear, namely Joe. You can feel the pain in his narration as he tells the last parts of his story; it becomes clear that Pip could never forgive himself for his folly. He wishes forgiveness from those that love him that’s why he forgives Havisham, but I don’t think he fully deserves it. He is repentant, but the damage is done.  Pip’s morale regeneration was a necessary facet for the brilliance of this work. It creates an ending that, for me, was perfect. It is not the ending that Pip thought he would get, but it is the ending this novel deserved. Pip’s morale regeneration and revelations are just not enough to offset the past. He has grown but, like Havisham, cannot turn back the clocks. The ending Joe receives signifies this; he, as one of the only true gentleman of the novel, receives his overdue happiness. Whereas Pip is destined to spend the rest of his life in a state of perpetual loneliness, he, most certainly, learnt his lesson the hard way.   Pip’s story though, ultimately, sad is not the most woe begotten of the character stories in this novel. Abel Magwitch and Miss Havisham are two incredibly miserable individuals because life has really got them down. Havisham is the caricature of the spinster; she is stuck in the past (quarter to nine to be precise) and is unable to move on; she has turned bitter and yellow; she has imposed herself to perpetual agony. Despite her harshness and venom there is a flicker of light within her soul that Pip unleashes. For me, she is the most memorable, and well written, character in this novel because her story transcends that of Pip’s. And then there is the lovable Abel Magwitch. The poor man had been used and cheated; he had been bargained away and sacrificed. He has been shown no kindness in his life and when he meets a young Pip in the marshes he is touched by the small measure of friendship the boy offers him. His response: to repay that debt, with what he believes to be kindness, in turn. These characters are incredibly memorable and harbour two tragic and redemptive stories. But, in order to display their anguish to the world and society, they both use another to exact their revenge. Havisham uses Estella to break the hearts of men, like hers was once broken; Magwitch creates his “own” gentleman as a revenge to the world of gentleman that betrayed him.  I love . It is more than just a story of love; it is a strong story about the power of loyalty and forgiveness; it is a story about falsehoods and misperceptions; it is a story of woe and deeply felt sadness: it is about how the folly of youth can alter your life for ever. It is an extraordinary novel. I've now read it three times, and I know I'm not finished with yet.\"],\n",

The fallout is placed under an intense microscope as a family is torn apart by the loss of their child…It’s funny what minutiae is stored in my brain sometimes. Years ago, I was looking through the clearance table at my local paperback swap store, when I happened across this book. It triggered a memory in my mind of a colleague telling me they had stayed up late one night watching a movie called ‘The Deep End of the Ocean’ which starred Michelle Pfeiffer. They described it as ‘absorbing’. So, I decided I would see what the book was like, especially after reading the synopsis. Unfortunately, the book has been sitting on my shelf all these years, and every time I considered reading it, I changed my mind. Now, as many of you have heard me explain, recently, I’m culling through my massive TBR pile and making some tough choices.  Any book that has been on the list longer than five years is automatically on the chopping block- so I had to decide. Read it right now… or box it up and donate it to the library…So here we are… The story starts off like any other book centered around a missing child. Beth is attending her class reunion and decided to take her children along. Her three-year-old son vanishes in a crowded hotel lobby, never to be seen or heard from again. While normally this trope crops up in crime fiction this book does not even remotely fall into that category, in my opinion.This is a heavy drama that explores the aftermath of losing a child and the effect it has on a family, a marriage, and the remaining children, examining the coping mechanisms each resort to in order to get by. The damage is horrifying and profound. It’s easy to judge, to take sides, the feel sympathy and empathy, anger, and frustration- sometimes all at once. Each character is flawed, or damaged and they go through years of emotional trauma before a miraculous turn of events opens an entirely new avenue of bittersweet hope and pain. The novel was published in the mid/late nineties, and it shows in many ways. Some outdated attitudes and stereotypes must be tolerated- some of which are offensive at times. But the main thing to keep in mind is that this is not a missing persons investigation- it is a family drama-and as a result, the pacing at times moved at a snail’s pace. I read two or three chapters a night, then changed over to another book never struggling to put the book down, until somewhere around the half-way mark when I found myself becoming much more invested- until finally, one night I picked it up and literally could not tear my eyes off the pages. It took a while to get there, but once all the chips were on the table it was riveting. Now, this scenario has been explored, even before this book was written, and countless times since, but the internal turmoil the story explored is especially profound and emotional, but also frightening, and very, very sad. The characters were not always likeable- in fact, often I wanted to scream at all of them!! Still, the situation demands that judgment be withheld and so I watched from a distance as events unfolded and felt all the emotions the characters did, but from a more analytical perch. It was hard, depressing, in many ways, but also very thought provoking. The saga does continue with a follow-up book, and I was pleased to discover the author delves deeper into this family drama, though I do hope it is not quite as bleak as this wrenching story. Overall, I am glad I didn’t box this book up just yet. It will still find its way to a new home, where I hope another reader will someday find themselves entrenched in this realistic, heart-rending story, and that it will stay with them, as it will certainly stay with me. 4 stars',\n",
       "    \" Beth Cappadora, excited about her 15-year high school reunion, packs up her three kids (Vincent, 7; Ben, 3; and infant Kerry) and her niece/babysitter and drives from Madison, Wisconsin to the Chicago hotel that's hosting the festivities.While Beth is doing some business at the hotel's busy reception desk Ben disappears. Police, family, and friends search all over for days, but Ben is simply gone.Beth and her husband Pat are shattered by the loss, and their remaining two children suffer from their parents' distraction.In time Pat is more or less able to go on with his life and his job - helping run his uncle's restaurant in Madison. Beth, however, can't seem to recover at all. She sleeps most of the time and, even when she's awake, Beth isn't really there.The Cappadoras try attending a support group, which is of very limited assistance.Vincent, who was supposed to be keeping an eye on Ben when he vanished, develops serious behavior problems. These become worse as he approaches adolescence and Vincent becomes a bully, gets into fights, and repeatedly gets into trouble at school.Vincent is sent to a therapist but does all he can to avoid addressing his real issues - thinking he's pulling the wool over his therapist's eyes.After a health crisis the Cappadoras move back to Chicago, where their extended family still lives. And miracle of miracles - nine years after he vanished - Ben shows up on the Cappadora's doorstep looking for a lawn-mowing job. The reunion isn't the total blessing Beth and Pat would have hoped for however. Ben doesn't remember them at all and has a fierce attachment to his 'new family' - the woman who kidnapped him (now severely mentally ill) and her husband George. To top it off George is a complete innocent in all this; he accepted Ben as his wife's child, 'adopted' him, and dearly loves the boy. The latter part of the book is especially heart-rending as Ben's 'two families' must cope with everything that's happened. What's everyone supposed to do now? Are Vincent and Kerry going to welcome their 'new' sibling? How does Ben cope with being a stranger in his own family?How does Pat deal with 'another dad' in the picture? What's going to happen to the kidnapper?The book tells a compelling story, the writing is good, and the characters seem more or less true to life. I had great sympathy for Beth but didn't like her much. She wallows in her grief for too long and makes (almost) no attempt to 'be there' for the family she still has. The other characters, especially Pat, seem to do the best they can in very difficult circumstances.In the end I felt the book was too long and overly melodramatic.The story reminded me of an afternoon special on Lifetime TV. The story rates 3 stars for me but - to be completely fair - I think some other readers might like the book better.You can follow my reviews at \",\n",
       "    'The Deep End of the Ocean (Cappadora Family #1), Jacquelyn MitchardThe Deep End of the Ocean is a best-selling novel by Jacquelyn Mitchard, released in 1996. Wisconsin photographer and housewife Beth Cappadora leaves her youngest son, Ben, alone with his older brother for a brief moment in a crowded Chicago hotel lobby, while attending her high school reunion. The older son lets go of Ben\\'s hand and Ben vanishes without a trace. Beth goes into an extended mental breakdown and it is left to her husband and owner of a restaurant, Pat, to force his wife to robotically care for their remaining two children, 7-year-old Vincent and infant daughter Kerry.Nine years later a young boy named Sam asks Beth if she needs the lawn mowed. Beth suspects that this boy who lives with his \"father\" two blocks away is in fact her lost son, and while Sam mows the lawn, she takes photographs of him to show to her husband and teenage son, who then says that he suspected the boy\\'s true identity all along. The parents contact Detective Candy Bliss who pops in to offer wise, albeit often cryptic and conflicting, advice to Beth. It is learned that at the reunion in Chicago, the celebrity alumna Cecil Lockhart kidnapped Ben, renamed him Sam, and raised him as her own child until she was committed to a mental hospital, leaving Sam to be raised in a house only two blocks from the Cappadoras, by his adoptive father, the sensitive and intellectual George Karras. ...تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز دوازدهم ماه نوامبر سال 2009 میلادیعنوان: ان\\u200dت\\u200dه\\u200dای\\u200c ع\\u200dم\\u200dی\\u200dق\\u200c اق\\u200dی\\u200dان\\u200dوس\\u200c؛ نویسنده: ژاک\\u200dل\\u200dی\\u200dن\\u200c م\\u200dی\\u200dچ\\u200dارد\\u200f\\u202b؛ مت\\u200dرج\\u200dم: س\\u200dرور ق\\u200dاس\\u200dم\\u200dی\\u200c؛ \\u200f\\u202bش\\u200dی\\u200dراز\\u202c\\u200f\\u202b: ن\\u200dوی\\u200dد ش\\u200dی\\u200dراز\\u202c\\u200f\\u202b، 1386؛ 567 ص؛ شابک: 9789643583125؛\\u202c\\u202c موضو: داستانهای نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده 20 مکتاب «انتهای عمیق اقیانوس» داستان رابطه و سرگذشت زن و شوهری به نام «بث» و «پت» است؛ داستان مسائل و رخدادهایی است که با از بین رفتن پسرشان «بن» برای آن\\u200cها به وجود می\\u200cآید. سرآغاز داستان مربوط به ماه نوامبر سال 1995 میلادی است؛ آن صبح گرم ماه اوت که «بث» پاکت محتوی عکس\\u200cها را درکشو قرار داد، در بعد از ظهر سرد پاییزی که آن\\u200cها را بیرون آورد، و عکس\\u200cها را یکی\\u200c یکی روی میز چید، و اکنون که ده سال بین آن صبح گرم و این بعد از ظهر سرد، می\\u200cگذرد. نقطه\\u200c ی آغاز داستان شرح ماجرای همین عکس\\u200cهاست. «بث» و «بت» تمام اسباب\\u200cبازی\\u200cها و اشیای مربوط به «بن» را طی این سال\\u200cها، البته بجز عکس\\u200cها را، از خود دور کرده بودند. عکس\\u200cها برای «بث»، که خود عکاس بود، طلسم شده بودند. آن\\u200cها آخرین اثر از «بن» بودند؛ شبی شاد و راحت. فراز و نشیب\\u200cهای ذهنی «بث» و «پت»، سرگذشت زندگی آن دو و زندگی مجزای هریک از آن\\u200cها در ادامه\\u200c ی داستان بیان می\\u200cشود. ا. شربیانی',\n",

If this was written within the last decade, Jonathan would be coping with his outcast status by wearing a black trench coat and rolling 20-sided dice for fun. He would also achieve a loyal following of other socially awkward birds by totally kicking ass in Guitar Hero.Sadly, this was written in the halcyon days of the 70\\'s, so Jonathan goes on a soul searching quest and learns how to fly better than any other seagull. Gradually, other seagulls join him and become awesome too.No, I\\'m not describing a children\\'s picture book. I\\'m talking about a book that bookstores actually shelve in the \"literature\" section. I honestly think that there are more photographs of seagulls in this book than there are paragraphs.

       "    'Jonathan Livingston Seagull, written by Richard Bach, and illustrated by Russell Munson is a fable in novella form about a seagull who is trying to learn about life and flight, and a homily about self-perfection. It was first published in 1970. In 2014 the book was reissued as Jonathan Livingston Seagull: The Complete Edition, which added a 17-page fourth part to the story. The book tells the story of Jonathan Livingston Seagull, a seagull who is bored with daily squabbles over food. Seized by a passion for flight, he pushes himself, learning everything he can about flying, until finally his unwillingness to conform results in his expulsion. An outcast, he continues to learn, becoming increasingly pleased with his abilities as he leads a peaceful and happy life.One day, Jonathan met two gulls who took him to a \"higher plane of existence\" in which there was no heaven but a better world found through perfection of knowledge. There he meets another seagull who loves to fly. He discovers that his sheer tenacity and desire to learn make him  In this new place, Jonathan befriends the wisest gull, Chiang, who takes him beyond his previous learning, teaching him how to move instantaneously to anywhere else in the Universe. The secret, Chiang says, is to \"begin by knowing that you have already arrived.\" Not satisfied with his new life, Jonathan returns to Earth to find others like him, to bring them his learning and to spread his love for flight. His mission is successful, gathering around him others who have been outlawed for not conforming. Ultimately, the very first of his students, Fletcher Lynd Seagull, becomes a teacher in his own right, and Jonathan leaves to teach other flocks.Part One of the book finds young Jonathan Livingston frustrated with the meaningless materialism, conformity, and limitation of the seagull life. He is seized with a passion for flight of all kinds, and his soul soars as he experiments with exhilarating challenges of daring aerial feats. Eventually, his lack of conformity to the limited seagull life leads him into conflict with his flock, and they turn their backs on him, casting him out of their society and exiling him. Not deterred by this, Jonathan continues his efforts to reach higher and higher flight goals, finding he is often successful but eventually he can fly no higher. He is then met by two radiant, loving seagulls who explain to him that he has learned much, and that they are there now to teach him more.Jonathan transcends into a society where all the gulls enjoy flying. He is only capable of this after practicing hard alone for a long time and the first learning process of linking the highly experienced teacher and the diligent student is raised into almost sacred levels. They, regardless of the all immense difference, are sharing something of great importance that can bind them together:  He realizes that you have to be true to yourself: In the third part of the book are the last words of Jonathan\\'s teacher: \"Keep working on love.\" Through his teachings, Jonathan understands that the spirit cannot be really free without the ability to forgive, and that the way to progress leads—for him, at least—through becoming a teacher, not just through working hard as a student. Jonathan returns to the Breakfast Flock to share his newly discovered ideals and the recent tremendous experience, ready for the difficult fight against the current rules of that society. The ability to forgive seems to be a mandatory \"passing condition.\" Jonathan asks his first student, Fletcher Lynd Seagull, before getting into any further talks. The idea that the stronger can reach more by leaving the weaker friends behind seems totally rejected. Hence, love, deserved respect, and forgiveness all seem to be equally important to the freedom from the pressure to obey the rules just because they are commonly accepted.In 2013 Richard Bach took up a non-published fourth part of the book which he had written contemporaneously with the original. He edited and polished it and then sent the result to a publisher. Bach reported that it was a near-death experience which had occurred in relation to a nearly fatal plane crash in August 2012, that had inspired him to finish the fourth part of his novella. In February 2014, the 138-page Bach work Illusions II was published as a booklet by Kindle Direct Publishing. It also contains allusions to and insights regarding the same near-death experience. In October 2014, Jonathan Livingston Seagull: The Complete Edition, was reissued and includes part four of the story.عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «پرنده ای به نام آذرب\\u200dاد»؛ «جوناتان مرغ دریایی»، «جاناتان مرغ دریایی»؛ نویسنده: ریچارد باخ؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش ماه جولای سال 1991میلادیعنوان: جاناتان مرغ دریایی؛ نویسنده ریچارد باخ؛ مترجم لادن جهانسوز؛ ویراستار محسن مدیری؛ تصویرگر و نقاش راسل مانسون؛ تهران، بهجت، سال1371؛ در 112ص؛ شابک 9646671020؛ چاپ دوم و سوم 1378؛ چهارم 1379؛ پنجم و ششم 1380؛ هفتم 1381؛ هشتم و نهم 1382؛ چاپ یازدهم 1385؛ سیزدهم 1387؛ چهاردهم 1388؛ هجدهم 1391؛ چاپ بیستم 1393؛نخستین بار در سال 1354هجری خورشیدی، با عنوان: «پرنده ای به نام آذرب\\u200dاد»؛ با ترجمه ی سرکار خانم «سودابه پرتوی»؛ در انتشارات «امیرکبیر» و در سال 1369هجری خورشیدی با عنوان «جوناتان مرغ دریایی»، و با ترجمه ی خانم «فرشته مولوی در کتابهای جیبی»، و با ترجمه جناب «هرمز ریاحی در کتابهای جیبی»؛ و با ترجمه خانم «لادن جهانسوز در نشرهای بهجت، کاروان»، و با ترجمه خانم «آذر حاجی\\u200cنجفی در نشر هدایت الهی»، با ترجمه جناب «عباس زارعی در نشر آموت»، و با ترجمه خانم «پریسا شهرامیری در نشر کوله\\u200cپشتی»، و با ترجمه آقای «مرتضی سعیدی در نشر آزرمیدخت»؛ و...؛ و البته ترجمه کامل این اثر با عنوان «جاناتان لیوینگستون، روایت یک مرغ دریایی، با ترجمه خانم غزاله رمضانی از سوی نشر وانیا در سال1392خورشیدی» منتشر شده استهمان داستان «منطق الطیر» روانشاد «عطار نیشاپوری» است که «سی مرغ»، در پایان جستجوی خویش به «سیمرغ» میرسند، داستان اینبار دستمایه ی «ریچارد باخ» شده است؛ «سیمرغ عطار» در این کتاب شعرگونه، همان بهشت است، که «جاناتان» میپرسد: «آیا مکانی به نام بهشت وجود دارد؟» در پاسخ میشنود از «مرغ فرزانه»، که (خیر «جاناتان»، چنین مکانی وجود ندارد، بهشت یک مکان، یا یک زمان نیست، بهشت یعنی کامل شدن)؛ بخش چهارم کتاب را که در سال 2014میلادی به متن کتاب افزوده شده، هنوز نخوانده ام.؛ چکیده: «جاناتان لیوینگستون» یک مرغ دریایی است، که اندیشه های دیگرگونه، از مرغان هم\\u200cفوجِ خویش دارد، و برخلاف آنها که پرواز را وسیله\\u200c ای برای پیدا کردن غذا، و ادامه\\u200c ی زندگی می\\u200cدانند، «جاناتان» پرواز را، وسیله\\u200c ای برای هدفی بزرگتر و والاتر، و رسیدن به کمال می\\u200cداند؛ «جاناتان» می\\u200cخواهد پرواز را حرفه\\u200c ای یاد بگیرد، برای همین به تمرین دلمشغول است؛ رفتارهای گوناگون «جاناتان» حتی موجب نگرانی پدر و مادرش شده، و در پایان او از فوج خود تبعید می\\u200cشود؛ طرد شدن «جاناتان»، ماجراهایی را رقم میزند، که برای خوانشگر، کشش و هیجان ایجاد می\\u200cکند؛ «جاناتان» مرغی\\u200c است، که بارها شکست می\\u200cخورد، خسته می\\u200cشود، طرد می\\u200cشود، اما قدمی از مسیر رو به هدف خویش، به پشت سر برنمی\\u200cداردتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 19/05/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 03/05/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا.

       "    'You know, sometimes you should just leave fond childhood memories alone. But I have a hard time resisting any kind of challenge, at least if it relates to reading, so when Karly criticized my 3-star rating of this book (see the thread to this review for her very funny and halfhearted trolling efforts), I felt compelled to go dig out my old copy of  - and it did take some digging - to see if I could justify my rating.Unfortunately, I couldn\\'t.This flimsy and fluffy little book was a massive bestseller in 1972 and 1973. It\\'s a VERY unsubtle parable about a seagull who decides that the mundane life of squawking and fighting for food is not for him. He wants to learn how to  fly. The other seagulls are not impressed with his stunts and aerial acrobatics. But Jonathan Seagull is brave enough to defy the Flock and continue his search for perfection. It\\'s all very inspiring and affirming and I can see why a lot of people still love it. There\\'s actually a JLS website where people share their \"seagull stories\" of how they learned to overcome their doubts and fears and truly live, and they all tell each other how great they are. Fly free, beautiful white birds! And that\\'s all fine, as long as you\\'re not hurting innocent people, or neglecting those who need you, in your search to Find Yourself.But this book, as a piece of literature, has problems on so many levels: The heavy-handed symbolism. The simplistic worldview (spend all your time learning how to fly perfectly and all other problems will magically take care of themselves!).And the book tries to be all things to all people. Overcoming obstacles and achieving through your own determination and effort? Yup. Reincarnation? Got it. Christian symbolism? Covered. New Age mysticism? Don\\'t get me started.2 stars, because even if it\\'s on the simplistic and cheesy side, I still find a little inspiration and humor in the pages of this novella._________Karly tells me I\\'m way off base with my 3 stars here, which is based on my teenage reading of this book many, many moons ago. So I\\'m going to re-read this book (assuming I can find the dusty old copy that is hiding somewhere in my basement) and either agree with her or defend my position.It is on! *cracks knuckles*',\n",

       "   'Review': ['Some of my happiest, and most looked-forward-to days of the year are the ones that I reserve for the re-reading of Pride and Prejudice. To quote Austen herself from Sense and Sensibility: ‘if a book is well written, I always find it too short,’ explains perfectly how I feel about this book; no wonder she called this ‘my own darling child,’ for, for me, P&P is perfect in every conceivable way. It’s the kind of book, the moment you finished reading, you are tempted to start over again immediately. However, reviewing this is another matter… I’m excited, enraptured, but at the same time agitated, knowing that it’s impossible to do justice to the author nor to the book.During my first reading of Pride and Prejudice, I had known I was hugely underqualified to review this book, though at the same time I had hoped, if I read all of her books, I might, in time, write an acceptable review for this masterpiece. Now that I’ve read them all, and also P&P for a second time, all I can say is I still don’t consider myself remotely qualified to write an objective review. But it is impossible not share one’s opinions after reading this: this book, for me, is as best as it could get. So, for the time being, I’ll have to be content with writing what I consider to be a subjective overview, which, I’m certain, does not do much justice. However, I hope that someday my sense in classical literature would become good enough to truly appreciate how remarkable this book is.Starting with the plot, which has been thoroughly analyzed, criticized, and commented upon by thousands of readers, is surprisingly, at a glance, not that original, especially if you see this as a pure romance novel. True, there are many complications resulting from multiple relationships (or marriages), but overall, there are many similarities. But what this special is Austen’s narrative: the sly humor, witty observations, unique lens through which she views the society, and the deeper understanding of morals of characters, are all perfectly concocted using her flawless writing style. And then there’s Elizabeth; aside from inheriting traits like humor and wit from Austen, she is lively, curious, confident, but without becoming ‘too perfect’ (like some of the Austen’s other protagonists). She is as delightful as it could get. Rest of the characters are also similarly entertaining, with each one infused with a myriad of qualities to keep the story interesting. I don’t think there was a single poorly written character in this book, and that’s the first time I’ve ever said that about a book. And I don’t wish a single thing had turned out differently in this story. With the exception of some of the children’s books, that’s also a first for me. Sometimes it’s hard to believe, that this has been written over 200 years ago, or this ever becoming dated. Unlike with most romance novels, you will not see the reasoning, or common sense become lost in the middle of the story, which I think will help maintain that timelessness.This second reading of the book only strengthened above opinions from my first read. If anything, everything felt even clearer, making the reading experience further satisfying. The only minor exception came with Lydia’s plotline. Compared to my opinion from the first reading, where I had been a bit angry with her, has been somewhat shifted a little towards sympathy this time. Obviously, same couldn’t be said about Wickham though. I also felt like that every single word here is essential during this second read. Although I didn’t skip a single word during the first time, I believe I enjoyed each sentence a lot more this time.Until now (that is till I finish my second read), I’ve never watched any of the TV or movie adaptations of this book. To be honest, I didn’t want to have any negative impact towards the perfect imaginary picture Austen had created. But after this second read, I decided to watch the 2005 movie, the 1995 TV series and the 1980 series, and couldn’t resist sharing some of my thought. As much as I appreciate the effort, the 2005 movie did not prove to be a worthy portrayal, at least for me. Maybe it’s the modern characters, or what had to be removed due to time restrictions, or deviations from original book, but at the end of the day, I cannot say I loved it that much. But the 1995 series was quite the surprise! It literally had almost every single dialog from the book, with a few exceptions at the end. It did add up to five and a half hours of play time, but that was totally worth it. If you loved the book, and haven’t watched the series, do watch it immediately. As for the 1980 series, though I loved it a lot, it fell a tiny bit behind the 1995 series. But both those series are commendable portrayals.As for this review, I’m going to label this as a work in progress, which I’m hoping to update after each re-read.',\n",

       "    '6.0 stars. Confession...this book gave me an  and I am feeling a bit spent and vulnerable at the moment, so please bear with me. You see, I decided I wanted to get more literated by reading the \"classicals\" in between my steady flow of science fiction, mystery and horror. The question was where to begin.After sherlocking through my Easton Press collection, I started by pulling out my Dickens and reading  which I thought was jaw-dropping AMAZO and left me feeling warm, satisfied and content. It also made me made retrospectively pleased that I named my youngest daughter .After Two City “Tale”ing, I decided to give this book a whirl as I kept seeing it on GR lists of \"goodest books ever.\" However, I must admit I was hesitant going in to this for two big reasons. One, I thought it might be a bit too romantical for me. The second, and much more distressing, reason was that  was on many of the same lists as this book. Austen fans should pull a nutty over that one.So needless to say I went into this thinking I might hate it. Well, for the 999,987th time in my life (at least according to my wife’s records)...I was wrong!!! I absolutely loved this book and had a mammoth, raging heart-on for it from the opening scene at the breakfast table when Father Witty (Mr. Bennet) is giving sly sarcasm to Mrs. Mommie Put Upon. I literaphorically could not get enough of this story. I was instantly captivated by the characters and Elizabeth Bennet, the main protagonist, immediately became one of my all time favorite characters. Mr. Darcy joined that party as soon as he showed up in the narrative as I thought he was terrific as well.Overall, the writing could not have been better. It was descriptive, lush and brilliant. The story could not have been more engaging or intelligent and the characters could not have been more magnificentastic. Elizabeth and Fitz are both smart, witty, self-confident and good. Austen could not have written them better. Oh, and I am sorry if this is a bit of a minor spoiler but I need to add that George Wickham is a cock-blocking braggadouche of startling proportions. I needed to say that and now I feel better. This one has made it onto my list of  novels and is truly one of the classics that lives up to its billing.  ...Guys, do not fear the Austen...embrace the Austen...HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!!!

       "    '\"Pride and Prejudice\" by Jane Austen started off annoying me and ended up enchanting me. Up until about page one hundred I found this book vexing, frivolous and down right tedious. I now count myself as a convert to the Austen cult. I must confess I have been known to express an antipathy for anything written or set before 1900. I just cannot get down with corsets, outdoor plumbing and buggy rides. Whenever someone dips a quill into an inkwell my eyes glaze over. This is a shortcoming I readily own up to but have no desire to correct. So I admit to not starting this book with the highest of hopes. I did really enjoy Ang Lee\\'s \"Sense and Sensibility\" however and so when my friend threw the gauntlet down I dutifully picked it up.Boy did I hate him at first. To get anywhere with this book one has to immerse oneself in the realities of life and marriage in the nineteenth century. At first all this talk of entailment and manners just left me cold. I liked the language to be sure. Austen\\'s dialogue is delightful through out but dialogue alone (no matter how delicious) does not a great novel make.A hundred pages or so in though I started to see what a shrewd eye for character this Austen woman had. Mr. Collins was the first person I marvelled at. His character springs forth fully formed as a total but somehow loveable ass. From that point on I found much to love about this book. I was so into it by the end that I was laughing at some characters, sympathizing with others and clucking my tongue at an unhappy few. In short I was completely absorbed. In conclusion I must now count myself a fan of Miss Austen\\'s novels (and not just their fim adaptations) and do so look forward to acqauinting myself with more of her work in the future. \"Emma\" anyone?'],\n",

       "   'Review': [\"I read this one a while ago and some of the scenes are still with me. And because of the continual flashes in remembrances I have to put this book into my top five of all time. The prose is lyrical, the characters three dimensional. The scene that comes back to me the most is the one where the two main characters are befriended by a kid down in Mexico All three are detained by the Mexican police and the horse the kid is riding is one he'd stolen. The Mexican police take him off and shoot him while the two friends wait, helpless to stop it. A good book is about conflict and conflict is all about emotions. For me that is one of the most emotional scenes I have ever read. This is a story of comradery, romance, a story of loyalty and loss. This book is one of a trilogy. I didn't like the others as much as I enjoyed this one. I think I just talked myself into reading this one again.David Putnam author of The Bruno Johnson series.\",\n",
       "    'All the Pretty Horses is a novel by American author Cormac McCarthy published in 1992. Its romanticism (in contrast to the bleakness of McCarthy\\'s earlier work) brought the writer much public attention. It is also the first of McCarthy\\'s \"Border Trilogy\".The novel tells of John Grady Cole, a 16-year-old who grew up on his grandfather\\'s ranch in San Angelo, Texas. The boy was raised for a significant part of his youth, perhaps 15 of his 16 years, by a family of Mexican origin who worked on the ranch; he is a native speaker of Spanish and English. The story begins in 1949, soon after the death of John Grady\\'s grandfather when Grady learns the ranch is to be sold. Faced with the prospect of moving into town, Grady instead chooses to leave and persuades his best friend, Lacey Rawlins, to accompany him. Traveling by horseback, the pair travel southward into Mexico, where they hope to find work as cowboys. ...تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز دوم ماه ژانویه سال 2014میلادیعنوان: همه اسبهای زیبا؛ نویسنده: کورمک مکارتی؛ مترجم: کاوه میرعباسی؛ تهران، نیکا، 1390، در 416ص؛ شابک9786005906448؛ موضوع: داستانهای نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده 20مداستان در سال 1949میلادی، در «تگزاس» آغاز میگردد؛ و درباره ی کابویی شانزده ساله، به نام «جان گردی کول» است، که در آغاز داستان، با مرگ پدربزرگش، عزادار میشود؛ در این بین، مادرش تصمیم میگیرد، تا املاکشان را بفروشند، و مهاجرت کنند؛ اما «جان»، که رویای گاوچرانی، و آزادی را، در سر دارد، خانه را ترک، و به همراه دوستش، راهی «مکزیک» میشوند؛ «جان گردی کول»، و «لیسی رائولینز»، که نمی\\u200cتوانند رویاهای ماجراجویانه\\u200c شان را، در «آمریکا»ی پس از جنگ جهانی دوم، واقعیت ببخشند، «تگزاس» را ترک، و به سوی «مکزیک» می\\u200cتازند؛ این دو نوجوان، در آرزوی جشن مدام، در دل طبیعتی دست نخورده، به دوردست می\\u200cروند؛ اما این سفر پرامید، که می\\u200cبایست درس زندگی، و تجربه به آنان بیاموزد، به کابوسی دوزخی بدل می\\u200cشود...؛تاریخ 19/11/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 01/07/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی',\n",
       "    \" isn’t quite as grim as other Cormac McCarthy work that I’ve read but considering that this includes  and watching the HBO adaptation of his play , it's still so bleak that your average person will be depressed enough to be checked into a mental ward and put on suicide watch after finishing it.John Grady Cole is a sixteen year old cowboy in Texas a few years after World War II who was raised on his grandfather’s ranch after his parents split up. After his grandfather dies, the ranch is being sold off. With no where else to go, John and his best friend Lacey Rawlins ride off for Mexico. Along the way they hook up with a runaway kid who is nothing but bad news. After getting work on a large ranch, John catches the owner’s eye with his skill working with horses, but after being promoted, John falls in love with the owner’s daughter which leads to trouble for him and Rawlins.I guess you could say that this is a tragic romance or a coming-of-age story, but that’s like comparing  to the . Or saying that  is just a western. Or calling  a simple crime story. There’s a lot more going on than just a couple of kids running off to play cowboy. John and Rawlins get their eyes harshly opened to just how cruel and unforgiving the world can be and that pleasures like young love can’t possibly hope to endure in the face of that.As usual, McCarthy's views on life and death and good and evil won’t leave any sane person skipping down the street while whistling and looking for rainbows, but he’s so skilled that even his grim outlook has a kind of dark beauty to it.\",\n",
       "    '‘’The world is made of stories and these stories form cultural ideas about a place and time, such as all the mythos of the American West with ideas of heroics in hard times, gunfights, horses and living close to nature. But striping away the romanticisism reveals the reality beneath and the hard facts of life one must inevitably confront. Cormac McCarthy’s  winning novel, , blends the brutality and beauty of life in a stunning bildungsroman that strips away the mythos of the American West as the old world gives way to the modern one. 16 year old John Grady Cole is ‘’ when, distraught by his family selling the family ranch to the corporatization of oil, highways and industry creeping across the land, crosses into Mexico with friend Lacey Rawlings with his heart set on the adventure and heroisms of the cowboy mythos. But have they found paradise or have they entered a hell from which they will not make it back alive? Told in McCarthy’s ornate, signature prose and set in a threatening landscape that is practically a character on it’s own,  is a fantastic journey about border crossings: from one land to another, from naivety to understanding and from adolescence into adulthood. When  was published in 1992, buoyed by the win of the National Book Award it outsold all of McCarthy’s previous novels combined and brought the author finally into the spotlight. Not that there was anything lacking in his previous works— is often cited as a favorite—but the combination of McCarthy’s exquisite prose in a more plot-forward and less dense work has wowed critics and fans alike and it works well as an entrypoint into his works for that reason. This is a book that is difficult to put down, the writing which is practically a protagonist to overshadow his own characters takes hold on the reigns of your mind and sends you galloping into the action and intrigue that never lets up. While a few parts many feel a little far fetched, such as the multi-day prison brawl and climactic showdown, the writing and imagery is so engaging and engrossing that you’ll hardly notice. McCarthy’s prose often reads like a cross between the Old Testament and , often with a lush loquacity that can also drive succinct and direct images into the reader’s mind and also expand their vocabulary. It moves as if with the natural world it describes, never being unnecessarily verbose but always a formidable force of language.‘’As the novel opens, we find John Grady Cole mourning the loss of his grandfather, losing his girlfriend and also knowing that soon he will lose the family ranch he always hoped to inherit. While he is full of gusto and confidence, we find him to still be a starry-eyed youth constructing the facade of being ‘a Man’ than actually having achieved maturity. During his break-up when she offers to remain friends he accuses her of being ‘all talk.’ When she responds that everything is just talk he says ‘’, an early indication that he values action above all else but it is contained in a scene where he displays a lack of maturity. The novel functions as a coming-of-age tale, with Grady learning to take responsibility for his actions as he moves towards maturation. ‘’A major part of his coming-of-age, however, is the waking from the dream of the American mythos. He is drawn to Blevins, the young horse boy they meet early on in Mexico, despite Rawlings not trusting him. Grady see’s him as someone of action, something wild and embodying the cowboy mythos of living in communion with the land. With Blevins, however, we see the tough cowboy act as a quick ticket towards disaster and cracks in the mythos begin to reveal itself as juvenile. The horrific end this leads to is enough to shock anyone awake into the reality of life and death, and suddenly posturing is shown to have deadly consequences ready to snatch you from this world. It’s a scene I’ll never forget, blunt as a gunshot, and told in such a way as to leave you teeming with details that suddenly become muted in the aftershock.Much of this novel is about border crossings, a multi-functional metaphor that encompasses both physical and emotional spaces. There is also the crossing from idealization into acceptance of reality. Grady resents the loss of the myth of the American West as industrialization and modernization take over, idealizing Mexico as a fresh wilderness full of adventure he can live out his cowboy fantasies within (which, okay, a bit problematic in the ‘savage Others’ way). When Grady and Rawlins reach the ranch upon which they work, it is a sort of found Paradise to them, the promised land they had been chasing. Though along the way the land echoes different tones, depicted as threatening and violent (think the birds caught and dying in the thorns they pass). Grady’s actions, a metaphorical feasting on the forbidden fruit that is Don Hector’s daughter, Alejandra, quickly has them thrown from Paradise for their descent into Hell: prison. The book is rife with religious imagery and the crossing from Heaven into Hell, with a purgatory session in recovery later, adds a dramatic weight that comes alive and sinks its fangs into you through McCarthy’s prose.The prose does a lot of heavy lifting in this novel, where even a single word in Spanish in the dialogue is used to denote the ethnicity of a character. ‘’ says John Grady, ‘’ and in keeping with this belief, and that of action mattering more than words, McCarthy’s prose shows us what the characters are made of through how we see them respond and through the metaphorical language around them. Just as the landscape is a character in the novel, so is the language itself.‘’Perhaps the greatest lesson in accepting reality and waking from the dream of idealism comes from Dueña Alfonsa, who tells of the failed revolution and the reality that hit hard to those clinging to ideals. It isn’t to say that ideals aren’t worth fighting for, but the understanding of what can be done, what must be done to do it, and that some borders can not be crossed. ‘’ we are told, ‘’ Evil is real and will lead to death, and those familiar with McCarthy know that the unstoppable force of evil is often embodied in his novels. For Grady, this is learning that the Paradise he idealizes can never be his, but learning to love what can be his all the same. Which is the most meaningful part of this novel, that even amidst all the violence and darkness, Grady always holds on to believing in good and beauty.I enjoyed that there were so many strong women in this novel too, and that it was from women that the young men learn the truths of life. Dueña Alfonsa is a strong character, and so is Alejandra. True, much of her character exists for romantic purposes, but she is also a highly capable and strong character that even shows up the boys at riding. ‘’It can be seen that  adheres to the  narrative of the , with the boys setting out, meeting helpers, mentors, temptors and falling into the abyss where rebirth and transformation occur. The prison sequence, with Grady and Rawlins fighting for days on end, functions as the hellish catalyst for transformation. Once Grady has killed a man, heroics no longer seem so heroic. It is no longer something you do to be brave or be a hero, it is something you do because it is what you have to do. The romanticization of heroes and cowboy myths dissolve under the crushing weight of reality, life and death, and in this way we see Grady return home with a lesson under his belt. He left a youth, returned as an adult with a new found sense of self and purpose.‘’Cormac McCarthy’s  is a wild ride that tears at the fabrics of myths and tugs at our heartstrings all the same.

       "   'Review': ['As I have reviewed elsewhere in The Delinquents  Lola (Kylie Minogue in the film of the book) liked Joseph Conrad and so do I, but not as much as some. I suspect that Lola was reading Conrad as boyfriend Brownie was away at sea in the early days of their relationship and perhaps she was attracted to the fact that Conrad wrote about the sea and sailing. This book of 3 short stories was all about that subject. One could imagine Lola wondering what it was about this attraction to the sea hence her reading Conrad. What I find interesting is that the author of The Delinquents, Criena Rohan, should have her books heroine reading such a dense author. I mean let’s be true to ourselves here, Conrad is no easy read. I came into this book expecting what I got, dark and dense paragraphs that had me rereading constantly. Is having to reread a good thing? Yes and no. Typical of books like this they can tend to pass over my tiny mind, the nuances as it were. Of the three tales Youth and The End of the Tether were easy to read and interesting stories in themselves without having me think I was reading classics. The Heart of Darkness on the other hand……… dense and deep. I was happy to reread passages but I wish it was not so. It can take away from the experience I suppose. Though a noted classic in truth not for me personally. I get the reputation but something just did not grab me. Again it makes the star system kind of redundant in truth. How can I not give it 5 stars considering what it makes one think about? I finished The Heart of Darkness a good few days ago and have been thinking about it. In fact I played an audio version (something I had never done before) after finishing the read so as to get another voice as it were. In The Delinquents Brownie had snorted that if Joseph Conrad was a sailor he should have known better than to go writing about the sea – and who wanted to read about the sea anyway? Brownie would not have had the patience to even get past the first few pages I suspect. I can find no reference to Heart Of Darkness in the banned books lists in Qld. I presume that Lola may have got it from the library. I am going to give my copy to a young lass who I work with who is studying English Lit with a view to getting into the publishing industry. Hopefully she enjoys it.',\n",
       "    \"Have you ever tried any meditation technique? Well, just last year I began to make some research about it. What I found was truly compelling, so I decided to try\\xa0some of the exercises I read about, which I still practice sometimes on my spare time. There's a great gamma of those techniques and regardless of your religious or spiritual beliefs, all of them have one and only purpose: to help he who puts them to practice. Personally, they helped me cope with some issues, such as anxiety and insomnia; but, truth be told, there are some things — intrinsic, I've come to think — that seem to cling to the deepest regions of my being — dark things, perhaps. I'm no expert on the subject\\xa0— in fact, I hesitated about \\xa0bringing it up — but from what I've\\xa0learned,\\xa0all these techniques basically help you with introspective issues by tracking their source. In this inner and spiritual journey\\xa0you may find virtue but you may also find what Conrad chose as the title for this tale: a.Either the title\\xa0means the core\\xa0of an unknown region or a symbolism for a corrupted human's soul and mind, it provides the reader with a general idea of what he's about to encounter. For me, it seemed at first like a simple story about colonialism written in a plain narrative. The error! The error! Conrad is truly a master of prose and he's often regarded as a venturer in the modernist wave. It may be true, if we think of such a literary movement as something related to Proust or Woolf or Joyce, who wrote their masterpieces based on a fluent stream of consciousness that emerges from a simple object or idea. Thus Conrad introduces the reader to Marlow who relates a story of his days of youth to his mates — a story which is basically the whole tale. Furthermore, just like the modernists aforementioned, Marlow's descriptions of the scenarios, his thoughts and reactions to the events that shape the plot are very insightful; the author's label, nevertheless, rests in the sombre yet alluring way in which all of this is written. The outcome: a skilful, contrasting blend of a portrayal of the exotic external and the shadowy internal. (And I've come to think the sun and the shadows play an important symbolism in this tale.)Overall, Marlow's anecdote is about him joining, out of his aunt's influences, an ivory trading company in Africa and the dark affairs that occurred to him therein. So from the moment the whole process begins with Marlow being examined by a doctor and the latter asks him \\xa0, you get involved in an increasing tension and suspense that won't decrease until the ambiguos climax of the story which is marked my the famous words\\xa0 And even afterwards, in Marlow's last meeting, there's something melancholy yet gloomy and uneasy\\xa0about it.Most of the psychological thrill in the story is aroused because of the second main character: a certain, enigmatic\\xa0Kurtz. From the moment he arrives, Marlow's told about this personage's grandeur and his\\xa0to the extent that all the hubbub about him makes Marlow form an a priori image of him so that \\xa0goes from a name, to an image, to a place (that is the station where he dwelled), to an ideal, and lastly, to the personification of the man behind all of it.Some may not be fond of Conrad's way of portraying all of this, specially when\\xa0Marlow's, and actually all white characters' ways are somewhat tinted with white supremacy. However, as the story moves forward, and specially when Kurtz finally enters the scene, the writer's viewpoints become clearer. In my opinion, Kurtz fall is a fascinating depiction of what would happen — nay, what , for this\\xa0happen to Conrad himself — what happens when Man loses what he knows as civility, clearing the way for his most concealed passions and all those feelings he casts away out of social norms. For some, this timeout of sorts, this chance to be away from their routines and get to know a new culture, it could be a chance for introspection, to focus on one's mind, like it is done while meditating. However, Kurtz reaches his blackest shade: his heart of darkness. Thus he begins to gain power amongst the natives, but as this happens his greed grows too, so he begins to abuse of his authority towards them, who now see him as some kind of deity.Lastly, when Marlow returns to civilisation, everything seems to him so dull compared with the passion, the rage and perhaps the freedom he witnessed in\\xa0Africa, which helped me understand Conrad's stand towards colonialism, civilisation, and most importantly, humanity.The copy I read also includes three more tales:\\xa0\\xa0and. They were a superb introduction\\xa0but I don't think any of them was as magnificent as , in spite of their own greatness. They have many points in common, specially\\xa0, and all of them are written flawlessly and the feeling of uneasiness and\\xa0 is well preserved, but\\xa0 was certainly the grand finale for this book, and, hands down, one of the best tales I've ever read.\",\n",
       "    'A 3.75 star novella.I\\'ve read this fairly short novel praised on its back cover in the Oxford World\\'s Classics as \"The finest of all Conrad\\'s tales,\" some three or four years ago and found it a bit tough. This novel\\'s not easy to understand since Marlow, the chief character, enmeshed by the mystery and menace along his dangerous journey up the Congo River to relieve the formidable Mr Kurtz finally made his encounter with him. However, I found it enjoyable and kept reading it till the end. I know he\\'s long been regarded as one of the great English authors but his writing style is still impeccable, unique till, I think, few native speakers can match him. One of the reasons is that he wrote numerous English classics worth reading seriously (provided that, of course, you have time, endurance and admiration) and, famously, he has written his works in English as his third language!',\n",
       "    'I think this was a little over my head, apparently Conrad spoke like a half-dozen languages so maybe I lost something in the translation because I only speak one and 1/4. I got the main themes of imperialism, racism, the thin line between civilization and barbarism, but as for any specific thing that was happening in the book while I was reading, I\\'m really at a loss for. I did like \"Apocalypse Now\" though, for what it\\'s worth.',\n",
       "    'I came across this handsome hardcover published by the Folio Society early last month at the DASA BookCafe in Bangkok and got it to read the remaining two stories excluding ‘Heart of Darkness’; the stories being ‘Youth’ and ‘The End of the Tether’ in which the first I browsed a few pages years ago and the latter I recalled its title vaguely. Indeed, this trilogy-like book should have been entitled, ‘Youth and Two Other Stories’ but, understandably, its title has appeared as such due to the second title’s highly-controversial analyses and famously-critical debate among Conrad scholars, professors and critics etc. since its first publication in 1902 by Blackwood under the title ‘Youth: A Narrative and Two Other Stories’.Moreover, before reading this book there is a point to keep in mind since in his Note Conrad has notified, “The three stories in this volume lay no claim to unity of artistic purpose. The only bond between them is that of the time in which they were written.” (p. 23) As his readers, we can’t help being grateful for his summaries, a letter extract in Jeremy Harding’s superb Introduction that we should primarily read as an essential overview:One and two are told in the first person by Marlow … One, the story of a ship on fire at sea. Two happens in the Belgian Congo: a wild story of a journalist who becomes manager of a station in the interior and makes himself worshipped by a tribe of savages. Thus described, the subject seems comic, but it isn’t. Three, written in the third person, is rather sentimental. It is about an old captain. (p. 9)Reading such a 32-page ‘Youth’ is, I think, relatively enjoyable due to his unique narration and more understanding supported by reading its synopsis at . I was especially touched by his mentions of ‘Bangkok’ in various paragraphs/lines, for instance:‘We left London in ballast – sand ballast – to load a cargo of coal in a northern port for Bangkok. Bangkok! I thrilled. I had been six years at sea, but had only seen Melbourne and Sydney, very good places, charming places in their way – but Bangkok!… (p. 31)\\t‘ … This was done, the repairs finished, cargo reshipped; a new crew came on board, and we went out – for Bangkok. At the end of a week we were back again. The crew said they weren’t going to Bangkok – a hundred and fifty days’ passage – in a something hooker that wanted pumping eight hours out of the twenty-four; and the nautical papers inserted again the little paragraph: “Judea. Barque. Tyne to Bangkok; coals; put back to Falmouth leaky and with crew refusing duty.”‘There were more delays – more tinkering. … I loved the ship more than ever, and wanted awfully to get to Bangkok. To Bangkok! Magic name, blessed name. Mesopotamia wasn’t a patch on it. Remember I was twenty, and it was my first second-mate’s billet, and the East was waiting for me.… (p. 38)One of the reasons is that, as far as I’ve known from reading somewhere, Conrad enjoyed visiting Bangkok (How often? I have no information) and usually stayed at the famous , one of the first founded hotels in Siam then, the Oriental Hotel, eventually, its administrative committee have named a Conrad room as a fond memorial honor to his stays there. I’d like to say something notably interesting on his technique in his ‘Youth’ before ‘The End of the Tether’ that deals with a command mentioned five times uttered once in a while from Marlow’s relatively lengthy narratives, that is, ‘Pass the bottle.’ (pp. 34, 36, 39, 43, 45) which, presumably, suggests apt intermissions and the narrator himself needs something strong to keep him going and staying focused on the story. As for \\'The End of the Tether\\', it\\'s a bit disappointed because its synopsis isn\\'t available on the above-mentioned Wikipedia web page; indeed, it should be of great help especially to Conrad newcomers to better understand its characters, climax, setting, and so on worth reflecting and discussing for new ideas or inspiration. It\\'s probably formidable at first sight from its length covering 14 chapters, 138+pages so it should be better if its readers are informed for well-prepared reading instead of plunging into the mystery itself and, predictably, don\\'t enjoy reading Conrad.In sum, reading these three stories would give more light on their purpose of writing from Conrad himself since its first three-in-one publication in 1902, more than a century ago, which is quite a long life-span. Undoubtedly, \"Heart of Darkness\" has since been more famous than its two counterparts and still read by Conrad admirers.

       "   'Review': ['After re-reading \"Lolita\", I asked my local bookseller if she\\'d ever read it.She replied firmly, “No…and I’m not going to either. He’s a paedophile.”A bit taken aback, I enquired further, “Who? The author or the character?”Fortunately, she replied, “The character.”For me, this exchange showed how much “Lolita” can still sharply divide opinion, even within lovers of fiction.This wasn’t the conversation I had been hoping for.I had read “Lolita” in a couple of days, less time than my work commitments normally allow me, but I found it incredibly easy to read.Even though I was taking notes, even though I was conscious that Nabokov was playing games (even if I didn’t always know what game), even though there were unfamiliar words I should have looked up, I was constantly drawn towards the conclusion.I wanted to talk to someone about my experience straight away.My cheeks were still flushed, my nerve endings were still tingling, I had experienced the “spine thrill of delight”, I felt like I had just had sex with a book.Now, not being a smoker, all I needed was some post-coital conversation.And there was no one around to converse with.And the book wasn’t giving away any more of its secrets than it already had.Nor was it going to tell me I had been a Good Reader or that it had appreciated my attentiveness.It was back between the covers, challenging me to start again.At a superficial level, “Lolita” is a relatively straight-forward novel.Once you know that it concerns sexual relations between 37 year old Humbert Humbert and 12 year old Dolores “Lolita” Hayes, you just about know the plot.There’s a beginning, a middle and an end.A grooming, a consummation, an aftermath.Nabokov makes of his material a three act play.And he does so playfully, seductively, lyrically, charmingly, amusingly, dangerously.To this day, I cannot look at Humbert’s initials “H.H.” without pronouncing them in German, “Ha Ha”, and wondering whether the joke is on us.Beneath the skin of the novel, there is much more.There is a whole complex living organism.You can lose yourself within its arms for days, weeks, months, a lifetime.As long as your love of wordplay, your love of words and play, will permit you.Again, at a superficial level, there is an almighty conflict between morality and aesthetics happening between the pages.Whether or not Nabokov deliberately put the conflict there, he put the subject matter there.We, the readers, can supply our own conflict in the way we read his novel.Nabokov knew the subject matter would inflame us, if not our desires, then at least our morals, our sense of righteousness.Morality and aesthetics are intertwined within the fabric of the novel.They embrace each other in one long death roll, just like Humbert Humbert and Clare Quilty.We watch their interaction, open-mouthed, open-minded, but ultimately they have to be pulled apart or separated.When they are together, they are one.When they are apart, they are each other’s double.There is no doubt that sexual relations between an adult and a minor are not just immoral, but criminal as well.That is an unquestionable fact.From a legal point of view, the motive of the adult is irrelevant to the proof of the crime.The consent of the minor is irrelevant to the proof of the crime.If Humbert had been charged with an offence of sexual relations with a minor, he would have had no legal defence.Any question as to whether Lolita really seduced Humbert would have been irrelevant.In fact, the evidence might not even have been admissible, except potentially as part of the determination of the penalty.In other words, even if it was relevant to penalty, it was not relevant to guilt.Because morality is a social construct that depends on collective endorsement, he had no moral defence either.The personal views of the individual are not really that relevant to society’s determination that an act is immoral.The choice of the individual is to comply or offend.Humbert offended not just once, but untold numerous times over two years.He carefully planned his seduction, he set his trap, he caught his prey, even if someone might want to argue that this 12 year old seductress walked voluntarily into the trap.Having freed Lolita from the trap, he imprisoned her in a cage, and repeated his crime.Again, someone could argue that she had plenty of opportunities to flee the cage (which she eventually did).But Humbert surrounded Lolita with an elaborate system of self-doubt that convinced her that she would become a ward of the state if they were found out.“Lolita” is written from Humbert’s point of view.It is not just a recollection in his mind, it is a formal, written document.He sat down and wrote it in 56 days between his capture in 1952 (charged only with the crime of murdering Clare Quilty) and his death in prison before his trial could occur.For me, the written document is a fascinating choice of literary device to tell the story.The document becomes a book within a book.While Nabokov obviously wrote it, all that he purports to do is sandwich it between a Foreword and a (much later) Afterword.This device sets up an interesting relationship between Humbert and the reader.For Humbert, it is akin to a confession or a witness statement.To this extent, what he confesses to is clearly enough to convict him of the crime of murder.However, in it, he also sets out details of crimes that, for whatever reason, he was never charged with.If his lawyer had read the document while he was still alive, he would probably have excised all of the other confessions, because they would have prejudiced his client’s case (at least with respect to penalty).For the reader, the confession defines our relationship to the events that are described.We are cast in the role of a member of the Jury.This device allows heinous moral and criminal acts to be described and read and examined within a legal and therefore legitimate framework.In a sense, the book becomes a report of sorts on legal proceedings.We become legitimate observers and listeners to something that might otherwise have been prurient and offensive and illegal.Yet, we have to do our duty and participate in the legal process, because it is an important part of the justice system.Even though we have a legitimate interest in participating, I wonder whether we are still voyeuristic.Nabokov has trapped us in a game that persuades us that it is serious, but ends up being just as playful and perverse as the subject matter of the crime.In a way, Nabokov makes us complicit in a crime, if not Humbert’s crime, then perhaps our own thought crime.It is also material that, by the time Humbert’s confession is read, both Humbert and Lolita have died of natural causes.Humbert speaks from the other side of death.Nobody is alive, nobody can be hurt any more than they already have.I explored these issues, because I wanted to understand Humbert’s motivation for his confession.He is effectively pleading guilty.I don’t see any prospect for an insanity defence, even though he seemed to have been in and out of sanatoria at times of crisis.Equally, I don’t think that anything he reveals would reduce the penalty for the murder.To do so, he only needed to focus on his concern that Quilty had wronged Lolita in some way even worse than his own actions.But to confess all of these other crimes seems to be counter-productive.Similarly, I don’t think he was lying about the detail, I think that he was telling the truth, and that he was telling the truth, so that he could be understood, no more, no less.Humbert’s confession is not just the fiction of a dirty old man, it is not false or fabricated, it is not a mirage.No matter how immoral, no matter how deluded, no matter how selfish and narcissistic, it is his fact, his reality, his truth, his burden, his shame.His actions were the pursuit of a rational man, not an insane one.He was film-star handsome, educated, intellectual, talented, witty, charming, calculating, calculated, dangerous.There is no doubt that he was a talented performer, an exceptional player.However, Humbert is not an actor wearing a mask, performing some other fictional character or version of himself.I believe that we are seeing him for what he really is.He is as cunning, tricky, sly as a fox and as refined, elaborate, attractive as a peacock.His decoration, his ornamentation is part of him, his life, his loins, his sin, his soul.In pursuit of Lolita, he was prepared to lie and deceive in order to achieve his goal.I don’t believe that he was prepared to lie to us, if only because there was no point in lying.When occasionally he questions the veracity of his own account, it is solely to question the accuracy of his memory.However, he didn’t need to tell lies to achieve leniency, he didn’t need to tell the truth for some ulterior motive.By confessing to anything, he would only be found guilty of crimes he hadn’t been charged with in addition to the charge of murder he had been accused of.There was no point in confessing to anything extra, other than to tell the truth as he saw it.It wasn’t going to get him any sympathy or reduce his penalty, if anything, his disclosures would aggravate his penalty.To this extent, I don’t consider Humbert an “unreliable narrator”.I realise that some might respond that paedophiles are habitual liars and can’t help themselves.That might well be the case, but I think it is our horror at his crime, our moral judgment affecting our assessment of the whole of the person and shaping our (aesthetic) response to the book and the character.Perhaps naively, I want to find some good in him.Ultimately, whether or not Humbert’s love was morally wrong, I believe that he wanted us to understand his love and what he learned about his love by the end of his story. Technically, the sexual relations between Humbert and Lolita are not an example of “paedophilia” (which is a sexual preference for a pre-pubescent).While nothing moral or legal turns on the distinction, the sexual relations constitute “hebephilia” (which is a sexual preference for a person in the early stage of puberty).The name derives from “Hebe”, the Greek goddess of youth.Her name means youth or prime of life, and she personified both youth and immortality.She was the cup bearer who served nectar to the Olympian Gods to give them everlasting youth.For me, during the first part of the book, Humbert’s love was forbidden, but genuine.It was a transgressive love, in that it was a love of the particular aesthetic form that youth takes between the ages of ten and fifteen.The body is at its most perfect, it has not started to age, to wrinkle, to fill out, to droop, to deteriorate.After that age, the body starts to age, and he finds that physically unattractive (as in the case of his first wife and Lolita\\'s mother).OK, we all make choices about our love objects.How can we account for our choices?There’s no accounting for love.Still, at the heart of this aesthetic approach to love is a fear or disgust at aging and mortality.There is an unreality, a lack of understanding and acceptance of the cycle of life and death, a Peter Pan desire to stay forever young, forever immortal.I also think there is a self-love or narcissism inherent in this aesthetic view.I love the young, because I love the perfect form of my own youth.Since my youth, I have fallen, morally and physically.I therefore have to preserve the visage of my own youth.I wonder whether it is only possible to have this view if you have never had your own biological child.Parenthood is an education in the reality of aging.It is an illusion to believe that you can live and defeat it.But tell that to the cosmetics industry.So far I have talked of love in the abstract.In the first part of the book, I struggled to understand Humbert’s love and the above is what I came up with.I won’t say I had a sympathy for him, but I think I understood him and his love.I even understood his obsessiveness.How many of us, during the first throes of love, trap and oppress our love object, so much so that we are not able to see how oppressive we were, until after the relationship has been consummated, or morphed into something more mature or ended?However, things started to change at the end of the first part (the consummation) and into the second part (the imprisonment).Of course the love had to be consummated, but as unexceptional as the description of the event was, it highlighted the reality that the first part was a trap for Lolita to walk into.As playful and lyrical as the language might have been, it was sinister in intent.During the second part, having captured Lo, Humbert makes it clear that his love will last no more than three years, to be precise, 1 January, 1947 to 1 January, 1950, which are effectively her 12th to 15th birthdays.After this, statistically at least, Lo will morph out of her nymphet form.So Humbert\\'s love is solely for a definitive phase of her entire life, after which he expects and intends to abandon her.During this phase, Humbert’s goal is to maintain Lolita in captivity, to ensure her availability for him alone. There is no fairy tale promise of “happily ever after” or “’til death do us part” in this love action.There is no love or concern for the other, only selfishness and narcissism.I have tried to view the definition of beauty that appeals to Humbert as an aesthetic issue.I have tried to divorce it from morality, so I can understand it better.However, whether I think of it in terms of aesthetics or morality, obsession or love, the fact that it could be switched on and off at such identifiable times turned me against Humbert.He is in control of this feeling called love, at least, he knows with clinical precision when he will return to “normality” or a state of not loving.His love was a drug that he took too knowingly, he knew precisely when the feeling of the drug would wear off.So, I started to believe that there was no loss of self in his love.Instead, it was a heightened or gross act of narcissism.By extension, there was no sense in which he tried to \"satisfy\" Lo personally or sexually.There was no sense of a mutually satisfying relationship or intercourse (although to be fair, he doesn\\'t go into the sexual detail, except in terms of physical exertion).However, I got the sense that, when it came to consummating his love, it was just about sticking his dick into his love object.OK, lots of sexual relationships can be reduced to this fundamental penetrative act.Some men see femaleness as no more than a receptacle for maleness and its fluid manifestation, the cup into which they spill their seed.However, I started to feel in the second part that Humbert\\'s aim was to defile or despoil the beauty that had appealed to him in the first part (even if it was transgressive).And the three year zone of enchantment highlighted to me that Humbert would just go in search of the next beautiful nymphet to stick his dick into.So it became increasingly apparent to me that he was a serial despoiler of beauty, not a genuine lover or admirer of beauty.There is a hatred or disgust hotwired into this love.You don\\'t normally hate the flowers in your vase when it comes time to remove them and throw them in the dustbin.But you get the sense that Humbert would have been disgusted by his former love objects, his objet d\\'obsession, the moment that calendar clicked over.Obviously, this same disgust or loss of interest appears in more traditional relationships.It could lie behind the mid-life crisis when the guy runs away with the younger woman.It could explain the inability to accept the inevitability of aging, at least in our partner.It could explain we males who still picture ourselves as the immutable 20 year old who deserves a young and nubile partner (no matter how soft or old or fat or ugly we have become).So Humbert’s love can teach the rest of us something about our own love.I wrote most of my comments about the second part before I had finished reading the last part of the novel.I have to emphasise that most of what turned me against Humbert came from my reaction to his own words.Neither he nor Nabokov held back the material that would make me hate him.Still, I read on, firmly in their constrictive embrace, until chapter 29, when Humbert and the seventeen year old, married and pregnant Dolores meet again.What you think of Humbert and his love, whether or not you think he is lying, depends on your interpretation of the confessions in this chapter:This is just one part of Humbert’s journey.He realised that he still loved her outside the hebephile zone.However, he still clung to “his” Lolita, the Lolita of his deluded version of love.Obviously, Dolores is and never was “his” version of reality, she was her own person, and she declines his love a second time.Only then does he recognise that he “did not know a thing about [his] darling’s mind” or that “a North American girl-child named Dolores Haze had been deprived of her childhood by a maniac”.Then he quotes “an old poet” (presumably Nabokov himself):In other words, you can’t just indulge an aesthetic sense of beauty at the expense of a real human being, it comes attached to and constrained by morality.Morality, taboo and the law work together to protect innocence and beauty from those who would defile and despoil it.He was not above the law, he was no Nietzschian Superman.He was the fool in his own play.There are suggestions that Nabokov saw Humbert’s story as a tragedy, that Humbert only realised that he genuinely loved Dolores by conventional standards when it was too late.That might be so, but Humbert only had himself to blame.He was a victim of his own hand, and his tragedy was nothing compared with the one he made Dolores endure, so that he, too selfishly for love, could have his “Lolita”.',\n",
       "    'Now, this is going to be embarrassing to admit.As we all should know, reading and enjoying a book is largely about interpretation. People are not the same and we all view things differently; one individual might see a relationship in a book as \"passionate\" while another could see it as \"damaging\". When characters make bad decisions, some will view it as stupidity and others will view it as an accurate representation of humanity\\'s imperfections. Not only that, but time often changes the way one person sees things. A teenager does not usually have the same outlook on life and relationships that someone of thirty does, and neither of them have the same outlook as someone of seventy does.So it\\'s time that I admit, when reading this at thirteen, my younger brain actually romanticised Humbert\\'s depravity and saw the relationship between him and Lolita as some tragic love affair. It was (surprise, surprise)  that made me wonder if I\\'d had a screw loose when reading this years ago. Her interpretation was so far from what I remembered that I simply had to find time for a re-read. This summer, I did just that. I am going to point the shameful finger of blame at my age when I first read it-- I was as fooled by Humbert as the young Lolita was.Humbert is not a reliable narrator; his declaration that Lolita was responsible for seducing him is repulsive and wrong. Because, in the end, an adult has no excuse for having sex with a child, even if they\\'re walking around half-naked and offering themselves up - adults have a responsibility not to take advantage of children. And I now realise this case is no exception. This is not some tragic romantic tale about forbidden love; it is the story of how a grown man repeatedly raped a young girl. The fact that it is so easy to be taken in by him either says something about how brilliant a writer Nabokov is (which he is), or how much society still loves to blame the victim.I don\\'t know whether to feel better about my original feelings or be horrified that even the description for the  describes the novel as:  And I also know that I have no right to criticise other people who saw it in such a way, but I would ask you to read it again, to look beyond Humbert\\'s snivelling and self-pity, to see the man who considers murdering a woman so he can be free to have sex with her twelve year old daughter, the man who feels sorry for himself when a young girl doesn\\'t want to have sex with him because she\\'s still hurt from the last time. Is that love? Maybe it was for a thirteen year old looking through Humbert\\'s perverted eyes, but I\\'m glad I understand it better now.Nabokov has written a brilliant and disturbing novel; my opinion of it hasn\\'t changed in that respect. I found it surprisingly easy to read and became absorbed quickly - even all those years ago. His portrayal of Humbert\\'s perverted mind is scarily good, perhaps even too good if people can so easily be convinced to side with a paedophile - which is often regarded as the ultimate crime of all, isn\\'t it? Even cold-blooded murderers go after prisoners who\\'ve messed with kids. And, as much as I feel ashamed for being so taken in by Humbert, I know that it\\'s not just me who was fooled. Hell, even the GR description proves it. But, believe me, Lolita is a victim and no amount of saddening flashbacks to Humbert\\'s past can change that.  |  |  |  | ',\n",
       "    'I wasn\\'t even going to write a review of  after finishing it, because, honestly, how many reviews does this classic need? That is, until I started pocking around and reading what others have to say about it. Many reactions to this book are puzzling to me. In this world of  and such, there are still people who find this \"erotic,\" who in the end feel some kind of compassion toward the narrator, who think that Lolita was the one who seduced and manipulated poor Humbert? Well, I beg to differ.  is as erotic as  is . As for favorable opinions of Humbert, I guess it is possible this effect can be attributed to Nabokov\\'s mastery of deception. Clearly, Humbert still, half a century after the novel\\'s publication, manages to fool readers, and himself, into believing that he is a dedicated, caring lover, wounded and changed by an early tragic romance. Only occasionally does the truth bleed through his self-delusion - Lolita\\'s wistful glance at a child sitting on his father\\'s lap, a simple act that is forever sallied by Humbert\\'s filth, her disinterest in life, her resignation to satisfy him for pocket money and permission to participate in a school play. No, Humbert did not fool me into feeling sorry for him. On a technical level,  deserves full 5 stars - the language, the wit, the world play! - I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever read anything like this before. But emotionally this look into a pedophile\\'s psyche is so disgusting, I can\\'t quite bring myself to rate it so. Humbert is so sickly real to me, with his apologies, justifications of his behavior, cowardice, sob stories and bending of reality, how does an author create someone like this? How did Nabokov get such an intimate knowledge of someone so despicable?',\n",
       "    'An old friend used to say that \"Ulysses\" was a good book to read but not a good book to \"read\". After reading \"Lolita\" I understand what he meant.Nabokov was a man obsessed with word games and this book is crammed cover to cover with many brilliant examples. Language delighted the man and that certainly comes across. What makes this acheivement even more amazing was that English was his third or fourth language. It is mind blowing that he or anyone could write so fluidly in a \"foreign\" tongue. If this was enough to make a novel great then this would be one of my top ten.But what if, as a reader, you demand that an author make his characters compelling and the narrative involving? I would say then that this book is not for you. Humbert and Dolores Haze (Lolita) only ever (to my mind) become three dimensional at odd moments here and there. He comes off as a mincing, foppish but ultimately unbelievable sort. I never bought into him until very near the end when for a few sentences Nabokov makes his remorse credible. But it is too late for that. I was already annoyed as hell by his rococo narration. The character of Lolita as well is shrill and one note through out. Only intermittently does she come across as worthy of compassion. As for the story, once the seduction takes place it loses a lot of its forward momentum. It begins to feel repetitive and only comes alive again when Humbert reaches the very end of his self control and attempts to lash out at one he believes wronged him. All in all I think this is a book that could stand to lose about fifty pages. There is much to love about it though. It could have been truly replusive. Nabokov knew that his concept was already off putting and that the execution need not be so. Rather than serving up spewing fluids and hungry orifices he treats us to healthy doses of wit and charm. Bravo!\"Lolita\" is obviously literature with a capital \"L.\" It is a work by a man of letters who happened to be a genius - for that reason alone it deserves reading. Just don\\'t be surprised that once you\\'re done you don\\'t feel like recommending it to anyone.',\n",
       "    'Nymph. Nymphet. Nymphetiquette. Nymphology. Nymphism. I will never think of 12 year old girls the same way. There’s a stain on my brain. The power of this book is that it’s creepy and taboo, but the pedophilia and incest is so damn plausible. There’s a criminal, upsetting proclivity of the subject matter, but the whole thing is oiled with reason--SAY IT AINT SO. It’s deviant, queer, puerile, and yet ever so human, darkly human, perverted in the corner. lingers in my mind, like an accidental glance at the mid-day sun. I believe this book will have a permanent effect on me. I’m thankful, but cautious. It’s a book that I experienced, not so much as read. There are 2 components to this book that radically affected me, the writing and the subject matter.I have never read another book written quite like . The writing has depth, layer upon layer, strata against strata, texture among texture. It’s a palimpsest of clues and anagrams and reference. The author has absolute command of the English and French and Latin language. And yet, among the $4 dollar words and bourgeoisie lit crit, Nabakov plays with the language. He invents words. He hyphenates them. He nymphorizes them. It’s a gamboling and frolicking story in the rarefied air of an unrestrained, unapologetic and unadulterated polyhistoric writer. It’s subtle and raw at the same time; it’s pure. Pure, like what happens in your neighborhood behind closed doors, just before an arrest. He incorporates a dry, brittle sense of humor--even a bit of sass. He taunts the reader to follow. He dares the reader to like and enjoy Humbert Humbert. He pokes you in the eye. He scandalizes you, but with a pen that is at once brutal and sensitive, but always careful. There are echoes of Joyce and Poe.The story is a retrospective from...from...from where? What? Prison. Ostensibly. And yet, there hasn’t been a trial yet--no judgement. Nabakov tantalizes you, “ladies and gentlemen of the jury,” to pass judgement on Humbert Humbert yourself. Are you willing? Or will you just turn your head, wincing?The writing is breathless, eloquent, exacting, alluring, inventive, sexy, pleading, conceited, lurid, savory, languid, and slyly self-deprecating. The author is flagrant, unapologetic, a dandy even. He whiffles the writing in so many little stylistic flourishes. He writes sentences and paragraphs in ways that I would never have guessed to try. It’s insanely periodic writing; I grab my head akimbo in pure awe of the sentences. I peeked at an annotated version for 20 pages at a local big-box book store. Wow, there’s so many levels to this writing, of so much I was ignorant. Did you know that under the shocking story of pedophilia, Nabakov is carrying on a paper chase with clues on almost every page? Yes, there’s a whole other plane of conversation hidden below the written words--grammatically, semantically, nymphatically. They’re buried in the french words, the double entendres, the onomatopoeia, the puns, the metonymy, the symbols, the rhyming, the nymphventions. Palimpsest “ladies and gentlemen.”We all know  is supposed to be shocking, revolting even, many people not able to finish it. Titillating, serious fiction about pedophilia is the clear edge of the literary envelope, something banned in many different communities, even today. At this particular time in our democracy, as one of the freest countries in the world, and the most progressive, we champion human rights and place a huge penalty on crimes against minors. In this spirit, we are supposed to decry and detest the subject matter in this book, and lambast the author. People are arrested and put on community rosters for crimes against minors. This 300+ page book chronicles a crime against a minor. Nabakov makes this an even more difficult sexual arrangement for his readers to contemplate, because the 12 year old is an eager, compliant and willing partner to the crime.In  the protagonist is a criminal and his actions unforgivable. BUT, if there was any method to his madness, it would have to be this:Humans share a cephalization process in common with most vertebrates. We developed cerebral hemispheres several million years ago (progressing beyond our closest ancestors), and more recently than that, humans learned how to use the cerebral cortex to reason, judge, cognate, and intuit. But, hundreds of millions of years ago, way down the taxonomic branch, we shared with other vertebrates a common mesencephalon and rhombencephalon, the midbrain and hindbrain. Tucked up under our marvelous, modern cortex, the midbrain and hindbrain, called the brain stem, are comprised of the pons, cerebellum, and yes, the MEDULLA OBLONGATA! These are ancient, compact organs. They are the most ‘animal’ part of our brains. They are in control of the lower order mental functions, the basic mechanistic functions upon which everything else depends. You can lose part of your cortex and still function as a human. You cannot, however, lose any of your brain stem without losing basic animal function. The brain stem is innately integral to life.It’s from this midbrain we get reflex, instinct, coordinated movement, sex drive, fight-or-flight, and a whole range of metabolic regulation for all organs in the rest of the body. The impulses (the input, the direction, the priority) originating in these Mesozoic Era brain organs are powerful. The cerebral cortex would be remiss to block an impulse from this deep, ancient brain--even if it could stop the impulse in time. It’s difficult for our human cortex to constrain an electrical input from the animal brain stem. What comes from the stem is automatically life-sustaining, life-preserving, and high priority. The cortex usually plays catch-up to brain stem messaging.But humans do it all the time. It’s called reason, judgement, cognition, and conscience. It’s called being civilized. It’s keeping in check our vertebrate impulses.Enter Humbert Humbert. He suffers an atavistic urge to procreate with young nymphets. This is a social problem driven and turbocharged by the midbrain. He understands (his cortex understands) that the culture of the late 1940s and early 1950s find this taboo and perverse, definitely criminal. But our poor Humberto doesn’t care. He reasons with his midbrain, and pleads to us, \"the jury.\" In the not too distant past within our own Western culture, and certainly in modern cultures of tribal peoples, 12 year old girls are ready to mate. Lolita has already menstruated and had sex with a boy her age. In many cultures of the world, Lolita would be given up as a wife in exchange for dowries of cattle, land, political favor. The whole story, then, brings this American taboo to a moral question. And its a question that you--modern citizen--find uncomfortable, like I do.Even more disturbing, Nabakov makes Humby Humberty a caring, loving, protective paternal figure that wishes Lolita the best in life. There is no direct, lewd reference to the act of sex; nothing salacious; nothing pornographic. No, that would be too easy to damn Humbo to the devil. Instead, Nabakov explores the possibility that real love may exist betwain the tween.I’m not too happy to report a phenomenon that happens to men of sexual capacity, always and forever. It’s an impulse from the midbrain, and it pushes through all that civilization-ing. It’s happened to all men (I know because it’s been a topic of conversation in many different social settings to which I was eye-witness). Take for example a young woman of 16 or 17 years. From afar I see a body in bikini, I see a tight, athletic form, I see a bronzed body wearing clothes much too revealing, and immediately the midbrain excites the male sex drive. Upon closer approach, I’m horrified to see that this nubile figure is much too young for me. Am I perverted? Criminal thoughts? I don’t think so. The midbrain wants to ensure successful mating, and for hundreds of millions of years, sexual mating, to be maximally effective, and to outlast environmental exigencies, was driven down to the earliest age that could conceive offspring. So that dastardly urge men experience around cheerleaders, or girls at the beach that look as healthy and trim as fresh gazelles--it’s not right dammit, and most of us keep it in check, but there it is and it’s nagging, and I wish it away. But no, I think it will remain and haunt me at times like it haunts all men--your men--your brothers and your fathers and your lovers. I look away in disgust of myself, call myself a ‘dirty old man,’ whatever it takes to recalibrate my thoughts. It happens occasionally--that oogling--but I keep it in check. But if you think society has civilized itself away from this midbrain urge, type into google the words: “list of sexual predators in my area.” You will see a Mesozoic characteristic come alive. So that’s why at the beginning I said this story was so damn plausible and upsetting and ‘oiled with reason,’ and darkly human. Pedophilia and incest has occurred, is occurring, and will always occur. That beast of a midbrain!A very important read for 20th century literature.New words: incondite, contretemps, swain, alembic, tombal, purblind, dulcet, treacle, edusively, viatic, selenian'],\n",

       "   'Review': ['Originally Catch-22 was Catch-18, but because Leon Uris was publishing a novel called  that same year Joseph Heller’s agent decided the title needed to be changed so as to not confuse the book buying public. Also given that 22 is a double 11 they liked the way it represented the many déjà vu moments that occur in the book. The East Coast publishing intelligentsia really embraced the book even though there were doubts if it would ever gain traction with the American public. I understand the frustration that publishers feel with the American book buying public. They have all been scorched by a book they felt should have sold by the wheelbarrow only to have it crash and burn with the majority of the first printing sold off to a remainder company. Sometimes a book needs a lightning strike in the form of Oprah or a school banning the book (thank-you Strongsville, OH), but for Heller all he needed was the 1960s. The book is set during WWII, the last good war according to everyone from Tom Brokaw to the school janitor at Phillipsburg High School. Fat novels glorifying the war, some extraordinarily good, were hitting bookstores at a fast clip from the late 1940s on. By the time Catch-22 came out in 1961 the world had changed. So those people who bought this book who thought they were in for another “weren’t we great” novel about World War Two were in for a shock. A typical reaction was:Some thought it was irreverent, but there were a growing group of people who thought it was among the best American novels they had ever read. Both reactions helped juice the novel and sales began to climb. At the tender age of 19 in 1942 Joseph Heller joined the U.S. Army Air Corp. By 1944 he found himself on the Italian Front as a B-25 Bombardier. He flew 60 missions most of which he categorized as milk runs; these were flight missions that encounter no or very little anti-aircraft artillery or enemy fighters. Heller admits that his disillusionment with the war in Korea colored the novel. It gives me the shakes to think how different the novel would be if he had published the book in 1951 instead of 1961. Little did he know how prophetic his novel would be regarding the Vietnam War. Yossarian has reached the end of his rope. He has flown the required number of combat missions several times, but each time Colonel Cathcart keeps raising the number of missions required to go home. A similar circumstance plagued Hawkeye Pierce and his fellow doctors in the Korean War based TV series M*A*S*H. The pressure of thousands of people he doesn’t even know and hundreds he does know trying to kill him is just too much for him to bear. As he becomes more and more insane(sane) he becomes more and more qualified to fly combat missions as far as the military is concerned. He comes up with various ailments to keep him in the hospital. He shows up to receive his war medal naked except for a pair of moccasins. He finally refuses to fly any more missions and begins parading around the camp walking backwards. This does start to foment rebellion among his fellow flyers and drives Colonel Cathcart to distraction. Heller surrounds Yossarian with a wonderful cast of detailed characters of which I will only be able to mention a few. Lieutenant Nately is one of Yossarian’s best friends, a trust fund baby with red, white, and blue blood running through his veins. He is a good looking kid and could have any woman he wanted, but he falls in love with an Italian prostitute who begrudgingly sleeps with him when he pays for sex with her, but would rather he just disappeared. He has this great discussion with her “107” year old pimp. Nately continues to be the straight man for the old man as they discuss the absurdity of risking one’s life for their country.Milo Minderbinder is in charge of the mess at the U.S. Army Corps base. As he learns more and more about how goods are moved around the globe he begins a business of supply and demand (war profiteering). He becomes the ultimate capitalist with no allegiance to any country. He trades with the enemy and as part of contract negotiations he also warns the Germans once of an impending attack even to the point of guiding anti-artillery against American planes and in another case bombs his own base to fulfill another contract. The absurdity of his position is that he is too important to the American high command to get in trouble for any of these acts of treason. He tries to explain one of his more successful schemes to Yossarian. Hungry Joe keeps meeting the flight standards time and time again only to have his paperwork take too long to process before the flight standards have been raised again. He packs and then he unpacks. He is a fat, pervert who convinces women to take their clothes off to be photographed by telling them that he works for Life Magazine and will put them on the cover. Unfortunately the photographs never turn out. Ironically he did work as a photographer for Life Magazine before the war. Women do play a role in this book mostly as objects of lust. Heller has these wonderful, creative descriptions of them. And then there is a nurse that brings Yossarian nearly to his knees with desire. .You will probably need to google the next one. Paradoxes abound even when Heller describes a character he will have countering characteristics like she was plain, but pretty or he was handsome, but ugly. Aren’t we all a sum of those characteristics anyway?This book is hilarious, (I laughed out loud at several points.)but wrapped with increasingly more tragic circumstances. As Yossarian’s friends die or disappear his desperation increases. His behavior becomes more and more erratic. The absurd traps him time and time again. There are a whole host of reasons why everyone should read this novel. I’m not saying that everyone will like it as much as I did, but it is IMHO one of the top five most important American novels ever written. It impacted our culture, added words to our language, and gave voice to a generation of people dissatisfied with the war aims of this country.

       "    'A  new  for my \"\" shelf. It has been awhile since I’ve so throughly  reading a novel that has, at the same time, left me as intellectually  as Joseph Heller’s classic sermon on the . What a sublime, literary feast. To prepare:1. Start with a surrealistic,  worldview basted in chaos;2. Knead in a plot reminiscent of , taking particular care that the bizarre, placidly disjointed surface fully camouflages the powerfully nuanced, and deceptively focused central message; 3. Marinate the whole thing in a dark, hilarious satire that would have made  beam like a proud papa. 4. Bake at 350, season with , and serve. Voila...a singular,  serving of inspired genius that I can not recommend more highly. This novel was so much more than I was expecting. Despite its pervasive, laugh out loud humor, Heller’s story is the most horrifyingly effective depiction of the  that I’ve ever read**. I’m not referring to the evil and vile atrocities perpetrated in war that have been so extensively catalogued throughout the annals of literature. Rather, Heller\\'s insight is geared to showing us the illogic of war, the out-of-control nihilism, and the chaotic, existential absurdity of it. It\\'s brilliant. I think any attempt at a plot summary is doomed to inadequacy, so let me just briefly frame the story. The novel follows the exploits of the fictional 256th fighter squadron, stationed on the fictional island of Pianosa, during the height of WWII. With a large cast of characters and a non-chronological narrative that switches viewpoints constantly, Heller creates a delicious cauldron of madness and bureaucratic ineptitude that is just heaven to follow. Our chief tour guide through the nuthouse is Captain John Yossarian, bomber pilot, whose main ambition in life is to . Yossarian’s life wish is so strong that he doesn’t even distinguish between the “enemy” and his superiors. As far as he\\'s concerned, the enemy  To avoid the final finality of death, Yossarian concocts a series of ingenious (and hysterical) methods for staying alive, including poisoning his own squadron and redrawing a the combat map during the “Great Big Siege of Bologna” so as to alter the bombing target. Despite his often less than moral shenanigans, Yossarian acts as the conscience of the story and helps to keep the rampant lunacy and chaos in context. His is the voice of indignity and righteous anger against the war and the cold, faceless bureaucracy that perpetrates it. Even against the God that allows it such horrors to exist in the first place. Loved it, loved it, loved it, loved it, loved it, loved it, loved it, loved it, loved it, loved it…and loved it. The writing is brilliant, the characters are unique, engaging and memorable, and the story will scar you with wonder and awe. I can’t believe I hesitated so long to read this, and I intend to sit down with this many times in the years to come. For those that have experienced this before, and for those who just want a stroll down memory lane, here are a few pearls that showcase this novel’s rather large package of absurd, satircal win. ********And a personal favorite (all leading up to the very last line): Finally, I wanted to share one last piece of awesome with you. The following is the contents of the letter sent by the base commander to the wife of one of the main characters.  Priceless…and what’s even funnier is that the set up of the joke occurs about 200 pages before. Masterful. 6.0 stars. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!',\n",
       "    \"The following is an example of how many conversations in this book took place.Jen: I didn't like this book.Nigel: Why didn't you like the book?Jen: I did like the book.Nigel: You just said you didn't like the book.Jen: No I didn't.Nigel: You're lying.Jen: I don't believe in lying.Nigel: So you never lie?Jen: Oh yes, I lie all the time.Nigel: You just said you don't believe in it.Jen: I don't believe in it, Jen said as she ate a chocolate covered cotton ball.Nigel: Well I liked the book.Jen: Fabulous! I liked it too!Nigel: What did you like about it?Jen: Oh, I hated it.I think Heller was showing how war is chaotic by not writing in a chronological order. You really have no idea in what order events are taking place. I think he was showing how war is ridiculous by writing conversations like the one above. I'm not sure if any of his goals were to annoy the living hell out of his readers, but he annoyed me. 460 pages of absurdness is too much for me. Most of the characters were very one-dimensional. I could only distinguish between people by their names. Most of the good guys all had the same personalities and the bad guys all had the same personalities except one character ate peanut brittle and another put crab apples in his cheeks. Other than that - same personalities. Maybe his goal was only to distinguish between the good, everyday guys and the evil, power-hungry men in charge. If so, he succeeded. I just wasn't thrilled after page 150 or so. There is some funny stuff in there. The chocolate-covered cotton balls will crack me up for life. There's some really sad stuff too. It's weird because every time someone died, I cared, even though I knew nothing about them, except what they ate or who their favorite whore was. I'm not sure how Heller pulled that off. Anyway, I would recommend it. It's just that the ridiculousness of it gets to the point where it's just, well, ridiculous, and beyond my personal tolerance level. I still appreciated it though.\"],\n",

       "   'Review': ['I read some people in Goodreads saying that this book is composed of fragments. I would rather say it is composed of silences between them. So many things are untold in “Anil’s Ghost”, but can be perceived and felt so clearly. To me this eloquent mosaic of silences was as important, as beautiful and poetic as Ondaatje’s words in this fragmented story. And what can better transmit the fear of the people caught amidst the Sri Lanka civil war than silence?Ondaatje loosely tells us about the situation in Sri Lanka during some of the worst years of the civil war, where people felt trapped in the conflict between the government, the antigovernment insurgents and the separatist guerillas. During these years people were disappearing in big numbers, their bodies later appearing in the sea, rivers, fields or crowded hospitals. More often, they became lost forever. The three conflicting groups were the main players in this terror, none better in its methods than the other, which meant that the only way for people to survive was keeping their heads low and being silent. Not asking questions. Not looking for the answers, not wanting the truth.Anil, a forensic pathologist who left Sri Lanka, her country of origin, fifteen years ago, comes back on a seven week mission to investigate the infringements of the human rights in the country. She is determined to identify a victim whose bones were found in the area protected by the government. Will her quest for truth be successful? Could naming one victim help her name and stand for all of them? Does it really matter which group is responsible? Can the truth be more important than peace? Anil’s local partner in the investigation is Sarath, a Sri Lankan archeologist, who finds solace in his studies. Archeological artefacts serve him as an anchor, the only things that are stable in his life, never changing throughout thousands of years. Sarath seems to Anil remote and impenetrable, difficult to trust because of his contacts in the government. And then there is Gamini, Sarath’s younger brother, one of the most beautifully crafted characters I have met in my literary life. Gamini is a doctor who is not capable of sleep, except for maybe a short moment in a bed of a ward, who almost lives in the hospital, never finding peace anywhere else, who is afraid of the dead, afraid to see their faces, lest he recognizes them. A doctor, a forensic pathologist and an archeologist. A study of the living, the dead and the immortality. The book evolves slowly, taking us back and forth in time, peeling off the layers of its characters, getting us closer to their nature, revealing one startling and uncomfortable truth after another, until we are sucked in, immersed in this wearisome journey and until it spits us out burnt-out and wasted and, perhaps, a little less ignorant.',\n",
       "    'Anil is an expat Sri Lankan, expert in the forensics of old bones. She returns to Sri Lanka to examine archeological remains and discovers evidence of recent atrocities. This is a portrait of a Sri Lanka riven with murderous conflict, a fascist state in which dissent yields death. Thousand are murdered on an ongoing basis, and no evidence of wrongdoing will be allowed to reach daylight. Anil fights her own memories of life in Sri Lanka, family, relationships. There are several memorable characters, including a disgraced anthropologist reduced to blindness and an austere life that he found satisfying, another anthropologist who gets Anil involved in the atrocity evidence. It is very interesting. Recommended',\n",

       "    \"My least favourite Ondaatje book. It all felt a bit flat to me. So much so that I'm struggling to think of anything interesting to say about it. Perhaps the main problem is the central character Anil who never came alive for me. She's something of a cliché, the career woman floundering in an affair with a married man. There's not much psychology in his creation of her. I never quite found her plausible, likeable or even interesting. Odd, because we're told too much about her rather than not enough. The most memorable thing she does in the novel is stab her boyfriend in the arm when he won't let go of her hair. This happens in America and seemed a wholly gratuitous and melodramatic gesture which had no follow up. The male characters were much more successful.  Anil's Ghost has all the ingredients to be a bewitching novel. As usual Ondaatje uses his novels to learn and write about exotic professions. Here we have a forensic pathologist, an archaeologist, a surgeon, an epigraphist. The setting is war torn Sri Lanka so he's writing about his native country. And yet all its compelling components never fell into place for me. Neither was the writing as inspired as is generally the case with him.  Ondaatje is brilliant at creating all the components of a thriller and then wilfully ignoring the simple formula for thrillers. The central quest here is to identify a skeleton and establish it's a murder victim of government forces. A kind of mystical sculptor is employed to give the skull features. This part of the novel didn't work for me. One night this man stabs himself in the neck, another bit of gratuitous melodrama that echoed Anil's stabbing of her boyfriend. I was never sure what all the hard, dangerous work was likely to achieve. No one, after all, is any doubt that government forces are murdering people. The identity of the skeleton, which might have been a compelling mystery, is passed over as of little interest to Anil and her companion. They simply need to confirm that his death was recent.  The characters are all solitary individuals, some by design, some by default. I'm not quite sure why no one in the novel was capable of sustaining a relationship. Is Ondaatje saying it's this failing that leads a country to fight with itself? Ultimately, I don't think I understood this novel very well, whether that's my fault or his I'm not sure… \",\n",
       "    'It’s the civil war in Sri Lanka. Anil, the novel’s heroine, is a forensic anthropologist and part of a team investigating possible war crimes. She is paired for the investigation with a government-selected archaeologist named Sarath, an enigmatic man 16 years her senior. Together Anil and Sarath find four skeletons whom they nickname Tinker, Tailor, Soldier and Sailor, the last a source of obsessive fascination. The task is to give Sailor back his identity in order to incriminate the government of war crimes. In the process Anil will have her own identity given back to her. As you’d expect from Ondjaate this is a novel brimming with beautiful prose. Its central theme is a kind of archaeology of the soul. Anil in the course of the novel will sift through layers of the soil of her own being and of her native country’s history, raising ghosts. On one level it’s a detective story but runs much deeper than that. Though not quite as far reaching as The English Patient it shares a similar structure - a mosaic of fragmented events that are eventually artfully interlocked. '],\n",

       "   'Review': [\"How the bigotry, insanity, and inhumanity of institutionalized stigmatization of and hatred against women, especially regarding pregnancy, marriage and the control about bastardization of humans, lead to disgusting world views and practices that were omnipresent just a few decades ago and still are in many parts of the world, is a key element of the novel.  Orphanages for kids that could have parents, but are born under the stigma of being illegitimate and thereby the societal death and endless disgrace and danger of ostracism for the mother, are a logical result and a part of the setting oft he bittersweet tragicomedy Irving serves the reader. Strong women, emancipation, and feminism are a key element of Irvings´ writing, possibly a side effect of growing up without a father and having an even deeper relationship with his mother, which leads to an idealization and glorification of femininity.  The role of fathers. How they react, what they think, want, feel, how different their opinions and mentality are in comparison to the mothers, how stupid social conventions influence the child-father relations, and what true manliness is. Maybe too influenced by the fact that Irving had no father, he dealt with this topic with an intensity many bad, disinterested, or overstressed fathers can´t or don´t want to invest. Autobiography and his writing are often the same and I couldn´t name a writer who added so much of himself, even very intimate and personal details, in his work. Only Irving knows how much is fictional and how much is true, but I find it amazing to use the gift of writing to make oneself immortal by taking pieces out of one's real life and make them fictional masterpieces.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: \",\n",
       "    'I shouldn\\'t be throwing semicolons around too often; and yet, after reading Irving, what do I find myself doing? semicolon, semicolon, SEMICOLON ; ; ; ; I\\'m not winking at you; those are semicolons.. now you know what I mean. Irving affects me in many ways -- the semicolons are just one example. (And yes, I know I\\'m probably not using them correctly -- you don\\'t have to point that out. You really don\\'t.) More than a week after finishing, , it\\'s still on my mind, still sneaking into my brain at different times in the day; still a part of me. Washing my face last night, talking to myself, \"Just a light touch there with the wash cloth on the cheeks there, Benny, -- just like Dr. Larch with the Ether, light touch\". And trust me, it\\'s not just that: I feel like I  the characters. And I think about them randomly, periodically, throughout the day. The novel takes place in the first half of the 20th century, in Maine. Most of this is at an orphanage hidden away in the remote town of St. Clouds; a former logging camp, now desolate, lifeless, and empty-feeling -- with its past of whores and ruffians still present in its aura. This is the perfect place for savior Dr. Larch’s orphanage, where he also performs abortions, which were illegal at the time. Larch was the only known abortion doctor in the area that didn\\'t provide them in dangerous ways - Doc Larch performed them correctly and safely, with great respect and care for the female’s dignity and health. This is also where protagonist orphan, Homer Wells, spends his childhood and teen years; where he learns to become Dr. Larch\\'s helper. He spent some interesting -- to say the least -- periods of time living with foster families as well, but finds that the St. Clouds orphanage is his real home. And then, true to Homer\\'s odd life, he ends up leaving the orphanage under unique circumstances. The story follows Homer into adulthood where he lives at “Ocean View Orchards”. During this time you get the feeling that Homer’s destiny is unfolding, but into what, you don’t know; you just know that it’s not going as planned. Homer also develops a powerful yet complex and taboo love; finds meaningful work; meets life changing people that are his new family, all while being away from his true father figure, Dr. Larch. There are a lot of interweaving storylines that result in humane, moral lessons that show through beautifully -- if not at the time, then at the end of the book, or after reflection. More than anything, this book got me thinking about abortion. I thought about it hard: more in-depthly and more seriously than I ever had before. It became something other than an abstract concept to me; I felt for the women that needed them,  I felt for the boy who believed that it was murder. It humanized the issue for me, and solidified my formerly tepid belief in a woman\\'s right to choose. It\\'s pretty clear that Irving agrees with this (a woman\\'s right to choose); a major part of the story is in fact, him making the pro choice point; but I could also see someone walking away from this with a pro life stance, or a more adamant belief in that stance. After all, young Homer was an orphan that liked his life and made positive contributions to the world, all of which wouldn\\'t have happened if his mother hadn\\'t chosen life. At the same time though, our story takes place when abortion was illegal, and you see Dr. Larch save lives, and the issue of choice itself is framed almost perfectly. The book made me realize the impact that an abortion, non-abortion, or botched abortion can have on someone\\'s life. You have no choice but to have an opinion on it after reading this book, because you get hit with the weight of its seriousness. has all the traits of a good Irving novel: the humane, odd, and likable characters with unusual life experiences; a storyline with moral undertones; profound scenes -- some zany and humorous -- others wise and touching. Don\\'t get me wrong, this book isn\\'t for everyone. It doesn’t take off right away -- someone with fast paced standards may even consider the whole first half slow. If you\\'re adamantly pro-life, you probably won\\'t find yourself enjoying this book -- abortion is too much of an ongoing issue. And abortion isn\\'t the only weighty theme here: betrayal, war, morality, laws-and-rules, the soul, incest, family, death, violence against women; the list goes on. Essentially,  is about the many rules of life: some written, others not; some meant to be broken; some need to be created. It\\'s about the concept of fate and how our decisions affect both our own lives and the lives of others -- whether they are from playing by the rules, or not. An exchange from the book sums this up quite well: “Every time you throw a snail off the dock,\\' Ray teased Homer Wells, \\'you\\'re making someone start his whole life over.\\' \\'Maybe I\\'m doing him a favor,\\' said Homer Wells, the orphan.\"This may not be John Irving\\'s best novel, but of the four I\\'ve read, it\\'s certainly his most important.',\n",
       "    'Something strange happened midway through reading , my first John Irving book.* I found myself completely immersed in its world.What’s strange is that for the first couple hundred pages, I didn’t particularly believe in this early 20th century Dickensian fable about orphans, surrogate families, an ether-addicted abortionist and the arbitrariness of some rules. But Irving’s storytelling skills eventually won me over. His prose is persuasive.Homer Wells is raised in an orphanage in the isolated town of St. Cloud’s, Maine. Although he’s been placed with families four separate times, something has always gone wrong with his adoptions, and so he continually ends up back at the orphanage, where he eventually assists Dr. Wilbur Larch in his unusual obi/gyn practice. Women come to St. Cloud’s to either give their children up for adoption or have the doctor terminate their pregnancies. When Homer is old enough to understand the latter, he decides to stop helping with those procedures. And when Wally Worthington and Candy Kendall, a glamorous young couple who’ve come to terminate their own unexpected pregnancy, tell Homer about the apple orchards back home near the ocean, he leaves with them, planning to stay just for a week or so to learn about orchards for the orphanage.The book essentially recounts Homer’s coming-of-age. Out in the big bad world, he realizes that evil and temptation exist, and that moral choices aren’t so black and white. Having grown up in an old-fashioned world, presided over by Larch and Nurses Edna (who’s secretly in love with Larch) and Angela, he’s been insulated. Choices seem so much easier in the books that he used to read to the orphans: Dickens’s  and  (for the boys), and  for the girls.In a sense, Homer sets out to realize his own great expectations, working in the orchards that Wally’s mother runs, falling in love with Candy and forging a lasting friendship with Wally. Meanwhile, Dr. Larch, who’s addicted to inhaling ether, is getting older; the board of the orphanage is looking to replace him. Will Homer eventually return?Anyone who’s only seen the film version will be surprised by a plotline about another major character, Melony, an orphan who initiates Homer into sex and feels betrayed by his departure. She’s determined to track him down, but her motivations remain vague. Revenge? Jealousy? Again: because Irving is such a smooth and skilled writer, the Melony sections are always readable and provide a bit of tension in a plot that can sometimes feel loose.A few other quibbles: Homer’s decision to leave with Candy and Wally feels odd, especially since he’s just met them. Often the book’s humour works, but just as often it feels contrived. And I felt cheated at the end when some big secrets are revealed – things we’ve anticipated for half the book – and we don’t get to see the characters’ responses. But I came to love Irving’s people. I loved seeing them interact with each other, pick up experience, get older, reflect on their earlier selves. They’ll teach you about the female reproductive system or how many bushels of apples it takes to create a vat of cider. They’ll make you consider how something as simple as a Ferris Wheel might seem mysterious and magical, or how it might feel to ride a bicycle if you’ve never ridden one before. I also liked the book’s central allegory about blindly following rules. At times the theme felt a bit didactic, but at others times it felt beautifully integrated into the story. The author has great empathy for his characters. And he knows how to create an entire fictional world. The details might not seem true in today’s busy, cynical world, but they do in the world of the book. And that’s enough for me.I’m looking forward to entering another one of Irving’s fictional worlds soon.---* I almost finished Irving’s  for a book club, but still had 60 pages to go before the group met.

This was a massive disappointment to say the least, and as always, I'll explain why.This book has many positive and glowing reviews, but for me on a personal level, it did absolutely nothing for my pleasure as a reader, or, my mental health. ( I wanted to desperately give this book away)The Cider House Rules could have been 200 pages less, and I still wouldn't have enjoyed it any better. The actual narrative was long-winded, tiring, and for the most part, consisted of pretty pointless descriptions that contributed nothing to the plot. The characters were skeletal in description, and I felt terribly distant from them. There was a complete lack of tension and whenever anything even remotely exciting happened, it was extremely anticlimatic. It got to the excruciating point, of me just not caring. And really, characters called Angel and Candy, do more than just make me shudder. Something else I noticed with Irving, which wasn't immediately apparent, is his rather odd obsession with women and their weight. This obviously doesn't sit well with me, and to be honest, who the hell cares how much a woman weighs? It obviously matters a great deal to Irving. There was no real structure to Irving's writing, and apart from the obvious medical terminology, his style was simple, and unsatisfying, and it appeared as though some sentences were strangely cut short at times. For a book primarily based on adoption and abortion, I honestly expected to have a winner here, but unfortunately, I'm left with a terribly bitter taste in my mouth, and a dislike for Irving.\",\n",
       "    \"I just finished reading this novel, and it is so phenominal that I'm almost speechless, and I'm sad that it is over. The story is engrossing, rich, moving, tragic, and satisfying, and the imagery is extraordinarily powerful. The plot takes place during the first half of the 1900's in rural Maine, and tells of Dr. Larch, an obstetrician, founder of an orphanage, abortionist, and ether addict, and his favorite orphan, and heroic figure, Homer Wells. Irving develops the characters superbly, such that the reader comes to know and love all of them, even those with significant flaws. The abortion issue is handled perfectly; while it becomes obvious what Irving's opinion is, he presents both sides of the issue objectively and refrains from preaching on the subject or becoming overtly political. Normally I recommend reading a book before seeing the movie adaptation, but in this case, the movie is excellent, so by reading the book first, one may not appreciate the film as much as one should. Irving is a storyteller on par with Dickens, and I'm going to add his other works to my future reading list.\"],\n",

       "   'Review': [\"Like Water for Chocolate is a popular novel, published in 1989 by Mexican novelist and screenwriter Laura Esquivel. The novel follows the story of a young girl named Tita, who longs for her lover, Pedro, but can never have him because of her mother's upholding of the family tradition: the youngest daughter cannot marry, but instead must take care of her mother until she dies. Tita is only able to express herself when she cooks.مثل آب برای شکلات - لورا اسکوئیل (روشنگران) ادبیات؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز چهاردهم ماه ژوئن سال 2012 میلادیعنوان: مثل آب برای شکلات؛ نویسنده: لورا اسکوئیل؛ مترجم مریم بیات؛ تهران، روشنگران، 1376؛ در 235ص؛ شابک ایکس - 964551276؛ چاپ سوم 1380؛ چاپ هفتم 1386؛ شابک 9789645512765؛ موضوع: داستانهای نویسندگان مکزیک به زبان اسپانیایی - سده 20مکتاب تا به پایان آمد، داغ داغ دوباره خواندم، آشپزیم بهتر شد، اگر از احوالات داستان خواسته باشید، ملالی که ندارد هیچ، بسیار هم همچون «شیرین» ما شیرین است، انگار کنید قند عسل، و همان دوران کودکی؛ خوانش دوم که به سرانجام رسید، انگار کردم، شکلات خوشمزه ای بود، که در دهانم آهسته آب شد، بار دوم دفترچه ام را از یادداشت پر کرده بودم، برای همین بود، که سه باره خواندم؛ داستان زندگی زنان نسلهای گذشته ی «مکزیک» است، که به سبک «رئالیسم جادویی»، و با زبان خانگی، و فُرم زنانه (نوشتار زنانه) نگاشته شده\\u200c است؛ این رمان، عشقی زیبا را، در کنار مبارزه ی یک زن با سنتهای جامعه ی خود را، نشان می\\u200cدهد؛ هر فصل از کتاب، با دستور آشپزی، یا داروسازی، آغاز شده، و به موضوع آن فصل می\\u200cچسبد؛ کتاب در سال 1989میلادی نوشته شده، و در سال 1992میلادی، فیلمی نیز براساس آن در «مکزیک»، توسط «آلفونسو آروآ»، ساخته شده است؛ به سی زبان ترجمه شده، و میلیونها نسخه از آن چاپ شده\\u200c است؛ عنوان کتاب نیز معنایی دوگانه دارد نخست اشاره به دستور تهیه ی «شکلات داغ (هات چاکلت)»، که در «مکزیک» با آب و «کاکائو»، تهیه می\\u200cشود (نه با شیر)؛ دوم، اصطلاحی در زبان «اسپانیایی»، استعاره ای از احساسات تند، و برانگیختگی استنقل از متن: (مادر بزرگم نظریه ی بسیار جالبی داشت؛ می\\u200cگفت هر یک از ما، با یک قوطی کبریت، در وجودمان متولد می\\u200cشویم، اما خودمان قادر نیستیم کبریتها را روشن کنیم؛ همانطور که دیدی، برای اینکار محتاج اکسیژن و شمع هستیم؛ در اینمورد، به عنوان مثال، اکسیژن از نفس کسی می\\u200cآید، که دوستش داریم؛ شمع می\\u200cتواند هر نوع موسیقی، نوازش، کلام یا صدایی باشد، که یکی از چوب کبریتها را مشتعل می\\u200cکند؛ برای لحظه\\u200c ای از فشار احساسات گیج می\\u200cشویم، و گرمای مطبوعی وجودمان را، در بَر می\\u200cگیرد، که با مرور زمان فروکش می\\u200cکند، تا انفجار تازه\\u200c ای جایگزین آن شود؛ هر آدمی، باید به این کشف و شهود، برسد، که چه عاملی آتش درونش را، پیوسته شعله\\u200c ور نگه می\\u200cدارد، و از آنجا که یکی از عوامل آتش\\u200cزا همان سوختی است، که به وجودمان می\\u200cرسد، انفجار تنها هنگامی ایجاد می\\u200cشود، که سوخت موجود باشد، خلاصه ی کلام، آن آتش غذای روح است؛ اگر کسی به موقع درنیابد، که چه چیزی آتش درون را، شعله\\u200c ور می\\u200cکند، قوطی کبریت وجودش، نم برمی\\u200cدارد، و هیچ یک از چوب کبریتهایش، هیچ وقت روشن نمی\\u200cشود.)؛ پایانتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 10/06/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 20/05/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی\",\n",
       "    'Have you ever finished a book and thought \"Man, this is going to be hard to review?\" Because that\\'s the first thing I thought when I finished this little book by Laura Esquivel. Like Water for Chocolate: A Novel in Monthly Installments With Recipes, Romances, and Home Remedies is a book that really left me conflicted. There were things about it that I absolutely loved, and things about it that made me very angry. The only way I can think to write this review is to explain what I found good and bad, and let you all come to your own conclusions.First, let\\'s start with the good things. I loved the way this book was written. Like Water for Chocolate reads like a folktale, and a fun one at that. Some people\\'s reviews that I\\'ve read found the magical realism trite or annoying, but I found it really endearing. The book managed to be an easy, quick read without sacrificing quality. Now, I cannot review this book without talking about the recipes. The book is split up into monthly installments, and each month has a recipe that Tita makes that ties the story together. The recipe is given at the beginning of each monthly chapter, and the instructions for preparation are woven into the story. Now, I\\'m a huge fan of cooking, so I found this idea to be really great. Since so much of the story takes place around and hinges on food, putting the recipes in the book makes perfect sense. I loved the way that the preparation instructions were included in the action of the story. Some people seem to find it gimmicky, but I thought it was a fun little addition to a book already filled with the tastes and smells of good Mexican cooking.Now, for the things that troubled me. First of all, I have to admit that even though I\\'m a huge lover of all things fairy-tale and myth, I do not like the \"love at first sight\" narrative. It\\'s not that I\\'m not a romantic, but I feel that real love is something that is built up from a knowledge of a person\\'s character and personality, not something that magically happens when you see someone from across the room. As for Tita\\'s beloved, Pedro, I honestly didn\\'t like him. He spent the entire book being selfish, immature, and whiny. I have no idea what Tita saw in him. While this book started out with that \"love at first sight\" narrative, there is a point that it has the chance to go away from that narrative and treat love in a realistic and touching manner. Honestly, that was the ending I was hoping for, so I was pretty well disappointed with how the book actually ended. For me at least, the ending was the worst part of the book. I feel like it kept the book from really having any particular meaning or significance, and instead just avoided any difficulty and wrapped up as quickly and neatly as possible. It just wasn\\'t satisfying.There were also plot elements that I found really disturbing. There are some *spoilers* in the following paragraph. At one point Pedro completely ignores all concepts of consent and just assumes that Tita wants to have sex with him, even though she has denied him repeatedly because he is married to her sister and she is promised to someone else. Does he care about this? No. Is this seen as a problem in the book? No, of course not. As soon as Pedro grabs her and pulls her into a room, Tita magically forgets all of her previous objections, and it\\'s just seen as more proof that they need to be together. Honestly, I find that to be pretty wrong. If somebody who I had repeatedly told to leave me alone just assumed that I didn\\'t really mean it and that I really wanted to have sex with him and decided to pull me into a dark room, I would kick him so hard he would never want to have sex again. It wouldn\\'t matter how much I actually loved him, if he can\\'t respect my decisions he is not worth my time. Combine that incident with the not-very-sympathetic treatment of a rape victim at another point, and you can imagine that I wasn\\'t exactly happy with the way this book treated consent. *End spoilers here* Basically, this book had some incidents that left me with a bad taste in my mouth, and made me wonder exactly what kind of love the author is trying to promote.Overall, the good writing and fun recipes in this book did not outweigh the problematic elements in the narrative. As much as I wanted to, I could not let myself simply enjoy this book, because problems with the plot and the ideas in the book kept jolting me out of the magical world of the narrative. This book was supposed to be a great love story, but I couldn\\'t help feeling that Tita ended up with the wrong man. The ending of the book was completely disappointing, and only served to cement my growing discomfort. For those of you who don\\'t mind the things that I mentioned, this book could be enjoyable. For those of you who want realistic love and respectful healthy relationships, I would suggest that you stay away from Like Water For Chocolate.Rating: not recommendedGood things: enjoyable writing, fun format, successful magical realismBad things: unrealistic love, unhealthy relationships, consent problems, unsatisfying ending For more reviews, visit my blog at ',\n",
       "    \"This book was disappointing. It felt overwrought and melodramatic.Tita, the youngest daughter of overbearing Mama Elena, has to give up the hope of ever marrying. It will be her duty to take care of her mother in old age. This becomes a big problem when she meets Pedro. When Pedro learns of Tita's duty to her mother and impossibility of future marriage, he agrees to marry Tita's sister, just so he can be closer to Tita. This sets in motion this fable of unrequited love that is the thread through the book.This book, put by some, into the category of magical realism, is not at all subtle or richly textured like others in the genre. Perhaps a better category would be tall-tale or fairy tale. If I had come to the book with that perspective, maybe I would have been able to hold back on all of the exaggerated eye rolling I was doing while reading. Also, I would have been more apt to forgive the book for the delivery of one-dimensional characters.Now, I did give this book 2 stars which means it isn't completely devoid of literary value. The language, though simple and spare was evocative, the recipes and description of food interspersed between chapters was a delightful diversion.I would only recommend this book to readers who have a high tolerance for love stories that tend to the saccharine. If you're a true Cinderella girl, you might enjoy the story without concern for its plausibility. Don't bother if you're more like me--interesting in rich characters.\",\n",

       "    'I couldn\\'t help but fall for this short novel that encapsulates vividly yet simply the lives of these women in Mexico during the Pancho Villa Years. The family unit is both necessary AND a culminating curse-- it\\'s hardly fair that our heroine must not live out the life she desires but the one that is handed down to her. A stupid family tradition (it is true-- mine\\'s a bit like Tita\\'s clan, sure, though not at all) dictates that the youngest daughter gets to take care of the matriarch and never marry nor fall in love. Tita does, of course, fall in love & her longing, desperation, & hope all are ingredients for the eleven dishes she prepares and shares with the reader. More than the story itself about shitty circumstances imprisoning a beating heart & a stunting of a passion that soon after becomes nothing else but a heavy burden... the mixture of recipe with story... the book is actually revolutionary in taking a vastly different approach about the way we look at the culinary aspect our (especially us Mexicans\\') lives. Whereas I got a sour flavor disgusting my palate watching such drivel as \"Julie and Julia,\" this book (the movie does it little justice, by the way) masterfully employs a type of rare literary alchemy* by mixing elements as one would mix ingredients to give rise to something as tasty as it is nourishing.*Speaking of alchemy, it must be mentioned that this has a similar voice and tone as that of (Madonna\\'s fave!:) Paulo Coelho (\\'The Alchemist\\', \\'Veronika Decides to Die\\')... but, seriously, a WAYYY more imaginative--& therefore more enjoyable--sense of storytelling.'],\n",

So I stopped reading and drove several three inch nails into my head, and I've been all right since then.\",\n",
       "    \"A Suitable Boy is a behemoth book of approximately 1,500 pages by Vikram Seth which is allegedly about a young woman named Lata who is trying to find a suitable boy to marry. The book centers on four different families as well as various political and social movements in India in the 1950’s. Never have I encountered a book that was more in need of an editor. There were far, far, far too many characters. The book starts off by displaying family trees, four family trees. However, that would not even cover all of the characters by a long shot. There were friends, politicians, teachers, sisters, musicians, and many more. The author really should have focused on a smaller set of characters and written several books rather than this mess. Additionally, this book was boring. It was like watching paint dry. If you want to read a great book set in India, I would highly recommend A Fine Balance. With so many characters in A Suitable Boy, it was difficult to connect with anyone. After the first one hundred pages, I thought that the pacing would pick up, but it didn’t. As if following 4 families wasn’t enough, this book was also some type of historical fiction. However, it didn’t work for me. The author would talk in excruciating detail about certain religious and political moments, but the reader wasn’t given enough information to put the moments into context. It would have been helpful to summarize the historical context or even hint at some of the context so that the reader could look it up. But I felt like I was thrown into the deep end of the swimming pool, drowning. After nearly 1,500 pages, the ending felt rather rushed and non-eventful. Lata makes her choice suddenly and with very little fanfare. This was rather disappointing after slogging through so much. The other disappointment with this book is that I could not find an audiobook for this book that was not unabridged, and the prose was not very smooth.

       "    'This is a magnificent saga, which left me breathless and awaiting the next word, set in India at the beginning of the fifties.\"Suitable Boy\" by Vikram Seth\\'s “epic love story set in India. Funny and tragic, with engaging, brilliantly observed characters, it is as close as you can get to Dickens for the twentieth century. The story unfolds through four middle class families - the Mehras, Kappoors, Khans and Chatterjis. Lata Mehra, a university student, is under pressure from her mother to get married. But not to just anyone she happens to fall in love with. There are standards to be met and finding a husband for Lata becomes a family affair in which all the members are to play a part.”“The richness of this book is remarkable. What with marriage, religion, customs, etc. it has been a really fascinating read for me.”India\\'s caste system has four main classes (also called varnas) based originally on personality, profession and birth. I’m eternally grateful to Fionnuala for suggesting that I may perhaps like this author. Do I like Vikram Seth? No, of course not. I just happen to adore him. I think that he’s absolutely splendid. I get the same pleasure reading this book as when I’m eating lobster or tasting a superb Burgundy wine or whatever sublime other pleasures that we have in life…My…I must confess that I had never heard of Seth before and I wouldn’t if it hadn’t been for Goodreads. It’s one of those remarkable books that becomes a reference book that once read, you can open it at any page and still get that continual enjoyment. It’s a wonderful sensation to savour…It’s always so difficult for me to write a review on a book that I “love to death” but that has been the case here. This is now my second favourite fiction book after “The Alexandria Quartet” and I could never do that justice. Bravo for the past for Durrell and for the present for Vikram Seth.In conclusion, Fionnuala and Seth – thank you for giving me so much pleasure. What a serendipitous find. I love this book.',\n",
       "    'I know some GR’ers didn’t really cotton on to the style of this book. And maybe it was because I read this while on vacation in India itself, but wow! Just W.O.W! It’s a fucking long book—1,500 pages. And every single page was worth the time I spent on it and more. If  is India’s , then  must be its . It’s got the same melding of personal lives seen in amidst great national events. Instead of the romance of Natasha and Pierre, it’s that of Lata and her three suitors. Instead of the war with France, we have the post-Independence and post-Partition politics of a nation searching for an identity. And instead of descriptions of war, we get exchanges of heated debate on the floor of the state parliament, and the passing of a contentious bill. Seth looks at the lives of four families intertwined by marriage and friendship. And all the detail—and it is indeed loving detail—is very very necessary to immerse you in the India of the 1950s, and what it felt like to be alive then. We get details of village life, life in the city, life of the different castes, business life, religious life, modern life, traditional life. It’s all there. And it works in tandem with several great stories of love and passion, and what these mean, both at the level of family, romance, and nation. Word has it that Seth is working on a follow up (not sure if it’s a sequel as such) to be called “A Suitable Girl”. I, for one, can’t wait. ',\n",
       "    '*Spoiler alert*I finally finished reading A Suitable Boy by Vikram Seth. For some reason, I used to avoid picking it up and kept putting it off. I suppose it was mainly the size (it’s one thick book - approximately 1500 pages!) but I also think it had to do with this misconception I had that it would be a tough read, that Seth’s writing would be pompous and saturated with flowery descriptions of rivers winding through the green and yellow village of GraamNagar. Imagine my surprise when I find that the language is smooth, his tone light and his narrative interesting. The fact that Seth managed to keep the threads of the numerous plots and subplots clear in his head is an accomplishment in itself, but even more impressive is how each characters of his story is real; they are people we recognize, with mannerisms we’ve noticed in ourselves and others, and dialogues we’ve heard, thought or spoken. The title might suggest that it’s the story of finding the perfect marriage candidate for the central character but that would be belittling the grand work that is A Suitable Boy. It is the story of the Mehras, the Kapoors, the Khans, the Chatterjis and a myriad of other characters, such as Saeeda Bai and Kakoli, many of whom are fleshed out substantially, even when their appearance is minimal. The beauty of the story arises from their interactions with each other, their thoughts and their ups and downs. Little details that create vivid images of a decaying courtesan’s world, a cosmopolitan Calcutta, the shoemakers’ rank (as in rancid) neighbourhoods and so on. The story covers about a year of the characters’ lives, detailing the day to day mundanity. Little decisions — a smile here, a letter there, a glass of nimbu pani (lemon-water) every now and then - are what makes the story. Yet these little decisions, these microsteps that are taken, culminate in huge changes that are noticed only in hindsight.I’m probably not giving away any surprises when I say that I was thoroughly pissed off at Lata Mehra’s decision to marry Haresh Khanna. I shouldn’t have been surprised because Lata does say in the first few pages, ” I always obey my mother” and so the ending wasn’t so much a surprise as it was a disappointment. I did understand why she did it, but I couldn’t help my acute disappointment in her all the same. I was genuinely frustrated at her pigheadedness, her thought process that led her to this decision. I was angry because I am afraid that her reasoning resonated with the coward in everyone, especially south asian girls who have had to, or will have to, at least discuss the concept of arranged marriage at some point in their lives.Ironically, her mother later suffered a number of qualms herself about whether Haresh would be the right boy for her daughter. Had Lata decided against the marriage, Mrs. Mehra would have been perfectly amenable, especially since Lata’s yuppie brother Arun did not condone the marriage either. So why did Lata decide to snub both Kabir, the Muslim she fell in love with, or Amit, the Bengali poet she could fall in love with easily? Her reasoning in the last few pages was scary because it reminded me of how we would rather our lives be a smooth ride of mediocrity than a roller coaster of brilliance that plummets from time to time. We choose to be mediocre-ly happy - the utilitarian idea that the “aim of action should be the largest possible balance of pleasure over pain or the greatest happiness of the greatest number” (). She says, “I’m not myself when I’m with him [Kabir]. I ask myself, who is this - this jealous, obsessed woman….I don’t want to [passionately love him], I don’t know want to. If that’s what passion means, I dont’ want it.”Once Lata makes her decision, we know that she will lead her life contently enough. It upset me because I saw Lata in a number of people I know in real life, including myself. Mind you, I am not advocating against arranged marriage as a whole because I know they can work. Lata’s sister Savita, who marries Pran after meeting him only once in front of her elders, does genuinely fall in love with him and go on to lead a happy life. So it’s not that arranged marriages are wrong. I just felt that Lata was wrong in her decision to marry Haresh. Even if he was considered fair and good looking, confident and ambitious. Ironically, from Haresh’s side, it’s not exactly a traditional arranged marriage. He arranges his nuptials himself because he doesn’t like the parents getting involved in this matter; his parents already know that he will run away (metaphorically speaking) if they try to set him up. So to Haresh, this is a decision he’s making by himself for his own benefit. Haresh had already been in love with someone else before, had neatly folded away his Devdas romanticism for that girl and was ready now to live a contented life with someone else (it just happened to be Lata). He is oh so bloody honest about his feelings for this girl, and that he knows it won’t ever happen and so must move on… Lata wanted his practicality, his forceful ability to get things done, his willingness to help out her family members. What angered me was the underlying assumption that Kabir/Amit couldn’t be all those things, that they would be selfish beings simply because they would also love her, and she would have to him (either him) back. My favourite characters in the book are Amit Chatterji and Pran Kapoor. I know Vikram Seth denies fashioning Amit after him, but to be honest, for some reason while I was reading about Amit’s tendencies for the necessary inactivity that comes with being a writer, I thought of Seth. What I liked about Amit was that he was the uber intellectual: his tone was oft-sardonic, his amusement frequent, his observations of people accepting and piercing. He talked a lot and said very little. He was cryptic in his cynicism. I loved him. Lata rejects him on the basis of his being \"high-maintenance\" type - someone who needs his meals laid out for him, who wouldn’t have time for her if he was working on a novel, and whose moodswings are as frequent as her own. I don’t buy that completely. He did make the time for her, he knew how to be charming and behave in society (he wasn’t an absent-minded intellectual), he knew what he wanted and he knew how to get what he wants. Lata was right in that he wouldn’t fall apart at her rejection, but I think it’s not his insensitivity that would allow him to be friends with her after her marriage, but his excessive civility, his sophistication and his writer’s acceptance of life.My other favourite character, Pran Kapoor - a thin, dark quiet professor - is a sweetheart. The kind of nice guy who doesn’t begrudge his mother-in-law’s long vacations with them, who plays April Fools Day jokes on people because “those who aren’t conscious of the date must take the consequences”. He is the ultimate good son, who quietly accepts his arranged marriage and falls in love with his wife. His was the real arranged marriage, in the true sense of the word, and yet you cannot dislike him or his wife Savita because they are both so lovable people, that you just know that they were destined to be together, no matter how they got together.For those of you who haven’t read it, do. Trust me, I can’t begin to describe the many shades there are to each character and how nothing I say will completely do justice to them. I got mad at one character’s one decision, not at the book. Seth is amazing. His voice is uninstrusive and style very graceful. That’s the word: graceful. Despite its size, you get a soft feeling reading it. True it is a tad tedious at times. Some of the political parts and some of the characters could have been done without. But in the end, you can’t get angry at someone who gives you the whole cake when all you asked for was a slice.'],\n",

       "   'Review': ['Long ago, in a galaxy far away, families used to gather around the TV every weekday night and watch the nightly news. This was before the mass of streaming sources we have today, before the internet, before, even, cable, before news was considered a corporate profit center. There were three national network news programs, on ABC, NBC and CBS. Each featured serious, strong newsmen reporting the biggest stories of the day, in an era before anchors were referred to as news . Walter Cronkite was prime among these. He was, arguably, the most trusted person in America, referred to, fondly, as “Uncle Walter.” One of the turning points in the widespread opposition to the Viet Nam War was when Cronkite made it clear on his national platform that the war was unwinnable and the USA should get out. One of the most moving moments in television history was when Cronkite struggled to maintain his composure when he learned, and In , Cronkite tells his life story, from roots in Kansas City and later Houston, through days as a sports announcer, from newspapers to radio to television. It is an interesting read from an American institution. He holds some rather progressive notions concerning war and peace, yet talks about how appalled he was at the clothing his daughter wore in the 1960’s. He is most entertaining when writing about his experiences as a reporter in Moscow, when telling about Mayor Daley and the 1968 convention, telling about Nixon, and the invasion of the newsroom by entertainment values. It is a pretty good and worthwhile read. But, surprisingly and sadly, given Cronkite’s importance in American culture, and his talent with words, I did not find it to be compelling read, which is what it should have been. But that’s the way it is.',\n",
       "    '',\n",
       "    \"A good autobiography on what is now an extinct breed: The great professional journalist. No longer will anyone in journalism have the reputation or credibility that Cronkite had during his prime. What replaces him these days cannot even compare. It is amazing to read how Cronkite saw the world, being a direct observer to some of the greatest events of the 20th century. Now, was Cronkite perfect...no. His commentary on Vietnam has been decried by several in the military and he made no secret of his political leaning (Democrat)...but in his reporting, most would agree, left and right, that he was a man who could be counted on to give you the straight story. It is unfortunate, given the pervasiveness of 24/7 media, that men like him don't appear to exist. Then again, reading Cronkite's work, he foresaw this...the dangers of 24/7 news outlets and how it would degrade the quality of journalism. It is a shame that it came to fruition. \",\n",
       "    \"3/5 stars.This took me just about two months to finish, however, I still found it an interesting read. Books like these, written by large cultural figures, can be either super intriguing or very boring, but I felt that Cronkite's book was in between. It dragged on during certain chapters but was very lively during others. I didn't know much about Cronkite before I read this, so I certainly learned much about him during reading, but if I hadn't had this book in my house I don't think I would have necessarily reached out to read it. I do wish that I was able to get through this quicker but alas, some books are just much slower. Glad to finally be finished.\",\n",
       "    'For the most part I felt the author to be mildly to moderately cocky, and arrogant in his narrative. This is understandable to some degree considering the fact it\\'s an autobiography and the natural inclination is to portrays yourself the hero, but at times it was almost too much to bear. While there were some moments of humility and humor, more frequently I felt it took on a \"snobbish\" tone and too much of it was a recounting of major events in which he participated in, or people he rubbed shoulders with or enjoys an intimate relationship with, elitist things he\\'s been able to do etc etc. blah blah blah; BUT, hidden throughout the text at random points are really astute insights regarding politics, society, media news, television culture and other various issues I personally think of often, and I feel are of major relevance and importance today. Because of this, I am glad that I \"soldiered on\" and finished the book, resisting my urge to put it down at times. Prior to reading this book I was familiar with the name, but knew very little about him overall. It turns out that he was a pretty cool dude, as far as this history buff is concerned; having participated in or lived through many events that interest me. It\\'s just a shame that he thought so too; lol. Had his celebration of self been minimized a little I would probably have rated the book a 5/5, but I would still recommend the book to anyone interested in journalism, or the history of his time.

       "   'Review': ['Before I get too deep into my review, let me just say this: \"Angela\\'s Ashes\" is one of the most depressing books I have ever read. That said, it is also fascinating, heartbreaking, searingly honest narration told in the face of extreme poverty and alcoholism. This absolutely entrancing memoir follows an Irish-American-Irish-American (more on this later) boy who comes of age during the Depression and the War years in a country gripped in the stranglehold of the Catholic Church, tradition, rampant poverty and unemployment, and the seemingly ubiquitous curse of the Irish: alcohol.Young Frank McCourt is born in American barely five months after his parents were wed. (Naturally, he will ask later about the math.) His father squanders the family\\'s wages at the pubs and soon the family (with new children seeming to drop on a regular basis) moves back to Ireland. Frank and his family move from slum to slum as his father drifts aimlessly from one job to the next and from one pub to the next, coming home at midnight to rouse his boys from bed, making them promise to die for Ireland. Everywhere for Frank is misery: at school, at home, in the weather, in the dreary conditions of Limerick, and in a fiercly pious populace. Forced to be a man long before most kids even have a paper route, Frank is soon working to supplement whatever his mother can get handed from the government or begging while his father is off working and drinking in England\\'s wartime industries. Frank dreams only of returning to America, where \"everyone is a movie star.\" This novel is so incredibly heartbreaking not only because it is true, but because it highlights the devastating conditions faced by millions (and which sadly continue). The work is a stinging indictment of alcoholism without being a polemic, merely a recollection of what was everday life of the narrator\\'s family, courtesy of his father\\'s drinking. McCourt\\'s supreme strength is in narrating the book through the eyes of his younger self rather than as an adult commentating or proselytizing about what he saw and did as a young man. The young Frank makes choices out of survival instincts and simply because they seemed right at the time (i.e. stealing to eat while promising himself to pay it all back later). On top of the normal perils of adolescence--sexual awakening and social awkardness--Frank, and countless young people like him, needed to grow up far too early to stave of homelessness for himself and his family in the absence of his drifter, drinking father. And ultimately, it is also the quintessential immigrant story of saving up enough to leave the Old Country behind in pursuit of a better life in America. Approach \"Angela\\'s Ashes\" with both caution and an open mind. Bring tissues and try not to condemn. Be like young Frank: Observe without damning. ',\n",
       "    \"What, did NO one find this book funny except me??? I must be really perverse.Although the account of Frank's bad eyes was almost physically painful to read, the rest of the story didn't seem too odd or sad or overdone to me. My dad's family were immigrants; his father died young of cirrhosis of the liver, leaving my grandmother to raise her six living children (of a total of 13) on a cleaning woman's pay. So? Life was hard. They weren't Irish and they lived in New York, but when you hear that your dad occasionally trapped pigeons and roasted them to eat, you develop a certain, er, resistance to tales of woe. They worked hard and did the best they could. And in between, life could be really, really funny. That's how I saw this book. After reading some of the reviews here, I'm beginning to think I read a different book. Or that I'm completely odd, which is much more likely.\",\n",

       "    'Angela\\'s Ashes: A Memoir is a 1996 memoir by the Irish-American author Frank McCourt, with various anecdotes and stories of his childhood. The narrative is told from the point of view of Frankie as a child. Born in Brooklyn, New York, on 19 August 1930, Frank (Francis) McCourt is the oldest son of Malachy McCourt and Angela Sheehan McCourt. Both of his parents emigrated from Ireland and married in a shotgun wedding over Angela\\'s pregnancy with Frankie. Angela is from Limerick, Ireland, and is fond of music, singing, and dancing. Malachy, from Northern Ireland, is an alcoholic known for his \"odd manner\" and for telling the stories about Irish heroes. Frankie is said to resemble his father, having a hang-dog face and the same \"odd manner.\"In Brooklyn, the McCourts live in modern tenement housing next to a park and share a floor, and an indoor lavatory, with other immigrant families. Frankie has four younger siblings in Brooklyn: Malachy, born in 1931; twins Oliver and Eugene, born in 1932; and an infant sister, Margaret, in 1935.The family struggles with poverty because Malachy Sr.\\'s efforts to find work are complicated by his alcoholism. The family\\'s prospects, and Angela\\'s spirits, lift whenever he finds a new job and brings home his wages, but soon he finds himself spending all of his pay in bars, despite Angela\\'s schemes to prevent him from doing so. He loses each job after a few weeks. ...عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «خاکسترهای آنجلا»؛ «خاکستر آنجلا»؛ «اجاق سرد آنجلا»؛ «اشک آنجلا»؛ نویسنده: فرانک مک کورت؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز هجدهم ماه سپتامبر سال 2001میلادیعنوان: خاکسترهای آنجلا؛ نویسنده: فرانک مک کورت؛ مترجم: پریسا محمدی نژنده؛ تهران، درفام، 1377؛ موضوع: سرگذشتنامه امریکاییهای ایرلندی تبار - آداب و رسوم مردمان ایرلند - سده 20معنوان: اجاق سرد آنجلا؛ نویسنده: فرانک مک کورت؛ مترجم: گلی امامی؛ تهران، فرزان روز، 1379؛ در 600ص؛ شابک 9643210529؛ چاپ سوم 1385؛ شابک 9789643210526؛ چاپ پنجم 13933؛ عنوان: اشک آنجلا؛ نویسنده: فرانک مک کورت؛ مترجم: زهرا تابشیان؛ تهران، نشر دشتستان، 1378؛ در 518ص؛ شابک 9649174877؛ عنوان: خاکستر آنجلا؛ نویسنده: فرانک مک کورت؛ مترجم: نینا پزشکیان؛ تهران، بدرقه جاویدان، 1380؛ در 618ص؛ شابک 9649345469؛ عنوان: خاکسترهای آنجلا؛ نویسنده: فرانک مک کورت؛ مترجم: منیژه شیخ جوادی (بهزاد)؛ تهران، پیکان، 1384؛ در 470 ص؛خود نگاشت زندگینامه ای اثر «فرانک مک کورت» است؛ «خاکسترهای آنجلا»، یا «اجاق سرد آنجلا»، اتوبیوگرافی نویسنده ی ایرلندی تبار آمریکایی، که در سال 1996میلادی برای نخستین بار منتشر شده\\u200c است؛ رمان زندگی «فرانک مک\\u200c کورت» در «کودکی»، و «نوجوانی»؛ در «بروکلین نیویورک»، و «لیمریک (شهری در ایرلند)» است؛ داستان، شرح زندگی فقیرانه ی «فرانک»، پدر دائم\\u200c الخمرش «مالکی»، که پولی برای خانواده باقی نمی\\u200cگذاشته، و نیز بازگویی تلاش\\u200cهای مادرش «آنجلا»، برای نجات خانواده است؛ خاکسترهای «آنجلا»، برنده ی جایزه ی «پولیتزر»، در رشته ی زندگی\\u200cنامه در سال 1997میلادی شده؛ «فرانک مک\\u200cکورت»، کتابک «تیز» را در سال 1999میلادی، و «آقا معلم» را در سال 2005میلادی، به عنوان دنباله ی «خاکسترهای آنجلا» به چاپ رسانده اند؛تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 11/07/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 09/06/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی',\n",
       "    'I think I read Angela’s Ashes by Frank McCourt initially when the book was first published. In high school at the time, my mother and I shared books. I was introduced to all of her favorite authors that way and most of these authors I still read now. One author who was new to both of us at the time was New York school teacher Frank McCourt who published a memoir of his life growing up in Brooklyn and Limerick, Ireland. As with most books from that era, I had vague recollections because I spent the next twenty years finishing high school and college and raising a family. Books I read in high school were not at the forefront of my mind. Since my youngest daughter transitioned to a full school day three years ago, I have gone back and read all of those forgotten to me books from high school through adult eyes. The experience has been for the most part positive with only a few books that stand out as disliking. With my ongoing lifetime Pulitzer challenge focusing on nonfiction winners this year, I decided to finally turn my attention back to Angela’s Ashes and found it a worthy book indeed. Angela Sheehan immigrated to America from Limerick, Ireland at the onset of the Depression. Life in the slums of Limerick was unbearable even for a champion ballroom dancer like Angela. Immediately after stepping off the boat, Angela meets Malachy McCourt and becomes pregnant by him. Being good Catholics, the couple gets married. Five months later, Frank is born, followed in close succession by Malachy, twins Oliver and Eugène, and Margaret. Malachy (the father) is a chronic drunk and spends all of his wages on drinks in local pubs. The children have no food, Margaret dies from SIDS, the twins wear rags for diapers, and Angela is inconsolable. At the urging of cousins, the family emigrates back to Limerick because as destitute as life is there, the McCourts will be among family who can support them in their desperate hour. Ireland and its green land of the River Shannon and Cuchulain the hero who died for the country do not solve Malachy’s drinking problem. He can barely hold a job and Angela and the children still have barely any food to eat. The children still wear rags for diapers and the family shares two beds in flea and lice infested apartments where an entire building shares one bathroom. The twins succumb to illness and all is too much for Angela to handle. Her mother and sister have no sympathy for her situation and the family is relegated to going on the dole and asking for handouts at St Vincent of the Destitute. The McCourts eventually move to a home at the top of Roden Lane. It is as decrepit as their other homes but at least no one died there despite having one lavatory for the entire street that is right outside of their home. Although a chronic drunk, Malachy makes the best of the situation naming the downstairs portion of their home Ireland and the upstairs Italy. The children rarely have food but at least they have each other and stories told of old Ireland by the fireplace each morning. Frank and Malachy and eventually surviving brothers Michael and Alphonsus attend the Leamy National School for the poor. Run by priests, it is a quality education despite the fact that most of the boys rarely eat, wear dilapidated shoes, and have parents who survive on the dole or handouts. The River Shannon and its environs sickens the air and Frank can name many friends and acquaintances who have died over the years of consumption. Yet, despite the horrendous upbringing that Frank McCourt knew, Angela’s Ashes had me laughing over the course of the book as he used humor to get through the darkest of situations of his life. His uncle Pa Keating was quite the character and interactions with him had me in stitches. Frank’s fear of confession to the priests and then his time in confession was also laced with comedy, as were most every other episode in the memoir, including dance lessons and mooching off school to run in an apple orchard with friends. If the situation was not so dire, perhaps comedy would not have been needed, yet Frank McCourt had a gift with words even as a kid. It was this gift that had his mother and other relatives telling him that he would go far in life in spite of the environs of Limerick during the darkest days of both the Depression and World War II. With a drunk father and destitute mother, Frank desired to go to America as soon as he had the means to do so. By age nineteen, he sailed on a reverse trip back to New York and Frank was in America to stay. Eventually Malachy would follow and they would develop a comedic act for two about growing up poor in Ireland. Angela’s Ashes, despite the impoverished environment that it describes, is one of the most inspiring books I have read. How could anyone have an attitude other than positive and expect to rise from the slums of Limerick and make something of one’s life. Frank McCourt could find humor in any situation, even one that saw his parents bury three children and live for nearly twenty years on public assistance. Angela’s Ashes brings to light this horrendous situation and has me realize that even though the United States was also hit by depression, it is still the land of opportunity for people around the globe, the McCourts included. Thankfully, Frank McCourt reached New York and eventually told his story to the world, offering a beacon of light in even the darkest of times. 5 stars'],\n",

Frank's mother, Angela, has no money to feed the children since Frank's father, Malachy, rarely works, and when he does he drinks his wages. Yet Malachy—exasperating, irresponsible and beguiling—does nurture in Frank an appetite for the one thing he can provide: a story.

These are all important things for providing worthwhile historical accounts of real events. The negatives are that D'Este focuses way too much on strategy rather than actual actions and what the events were like, he gets bogged down in providing a dozen corroborating sources when only three or four are needed, and he manages to strip away all of the emotion and drama of the events. It was informative but I prefer accounts that draw me in.\",\n",
       "    'This is not a history of the Normandy campaign; rather, it’s an examination of the command decisions and some, not all, of the operations within. Of the landings, only Sword Beach is covered in detail. The taking of Cherbourg is not covered; we just know it happened. I wish the Cobra breakthrough received a more detailed accounting. It may help a reader to look at Wikipedia, or read Hastings’ or Beevor’s accounts before to learn more of the whole campaign.The author critically examines General Montgomery and the British army’s actions during this campaign and finds much to fault. The army suffers from failure of coordination and a lack of manpower at the strategic level. The author takes Monty to task with an in-depth examination of what he claimed to do, or was going to do, and what he actually did. There was a difference! Chapter 26 on the Falaise action (or lack of it) was hard to follow, yet the failure to close the pocket wasn’t fatal. So what’s the point? The campaign was finally a success, wasn’t it? True, it didn’t enhance Monty’s reputation, but the author gives him points for his overall excellence in training and planning. Readers familiar with Alamein and the action at the Mareth Line know that Monty could flex when he needed to. There were times when I wondered this could be as mean-spirited as David Irving’s , yet overall there is enough excellent history of the command decisions that had to be made to make this book well worth reading.',\n",
       "    \"There is detail here and to the extent that the book explores the decision making process that formed a battle plan, and then evaluates how it played out, it is thought provoking for those interested in military strategy. However as others have surely said, there is a repetitive refrain here about how FoS Monty was, that comes back again and again. It would be an interesting if tiresome exercise to pick out how many times we are re-informed in a single-line sentence that Monty was inclined to arrange the facts to fit the story he wished to put forward. As if the reader needed to be reacquainted with the thesis statement periodically, just in case he forgot the thrust of case being built throughout so many sections of the book.I'm no expert in the field, but there does appear to be a trend in scholarship in harmony with what seemed to be Monty's long lived quest after the war - to rewrite the common evaluation of his generalship more favorably. This book is steadfastly, repetitively on the other side of that argument.Having said that, no one including D'Este sees Monty as any sort of massive failure as a strategist in what was ultimately a successful invasion and break out. And really, how much fault lies with the commander when the battle plans are implemented in such a way that the objectives are not met, as was the case in many operations aimed at taking Caen? It does seem that Monty was an inveterate fudger, spinner, slanter and credit taker throughout his career and his inconsistencies with facts on the ground appear to be whoppers. Hard not to concede that there was a pattern there. But what we may sometimes fail to appreciate is that his was a thankless job with many factors to balance (Ike-like, if you will) including war weariness at home and on the line, a man power shortage (however you regard the claim/efficacy of the 100k reserve on the British mainland), an incredible ability on the part of the enemy to resist in the face of dwindling resources and unprecedented bombardment and...general heavy sledding as regards of the taking of objectives. Plus, with the end of the war on the horizon, no one above him in the UK establishment would have welcomed boat rocking or anything that would weaken their hand in post war negotiations. What he did do was keep the situation together in a way that bent but did not break - he prevented disaster - so that the inexorable build up of numbers close to the coast where the allies could exercise the key tactical advantages of air superiority/naval and artillery bombardment would eventually reveal the opportunity for a coup de grâce and win the day. Be that as it may, a good and informative book on the Normandy invasion if you can tolerate the repetitious, unvarying barrage of criticism of the manner of Monty's fighting and, more to the point, characterizing the war.\"],\n",

This novel must have been one of the most scandalous- talked about novels - to hit the book shelves back in 1977. And..... it was a *FINE* read these past few days!!!!! By *FINE*, I mean a VERY ADDICTIVE compelling engrossing WONDERFUL read.....an epic that stretches our hearts beyond the Outback regions of Australia. Tidbits.........The relationship between Father Ralph de Bricassart and Meggie Cleary calls for a lengthy book club discussion- in itself!! Father Ralph says: \"I\\'ve known Meggie since she was ten years old, only days off the boat from New Zealand. You might in truth say I\\'ve known Meggie through flood and fire and emotional famine, and through death, and life. All that we have to bear. Meggie is the mirror in which I\\'m forced to view my mortality\". .....A theme that never got off the ground: Early in this novel, when Meggie was a small child - in school with the nuns- she became friends with a little black girl. Racial tensions between the families grew out of injustice when Meggie had lice in her hair. We soon move into part II of the novel. All we learned was the black family had to \\'move\\'. I thought we\\'d see more \\'racial\\' injustice stories - but this novel never followed that path. .....One of my favorite characters was Frank..... \\'the way\\' we discover his where-a-bouts years later was so darn sad. The \\'worsening psychosis\\' news comes with no background story. I was left hanging \\'too\\' long. Frank was often in my thoughts... I wanted more of him. His love for his mother, Fee, and only sister Meggie reminded me of \\'what\\'s right\\' in life. But I wanted more of \\'that\\' too- Yet so much tragedy-no Peace Frank\\'s father - Paddy - while growing up. Sad... just sad! .....Mary Carson - sister of Paddy, ( Meggie\\'s father) -was one hell of a nice lady -- ha!!!! A narcissistic snake! lol\"The good die young\"... was the only sentence that brought me to tears - the scene with Dane.. was pretty emotional- and that damn sentence \"the good die young\" is once of those sentences that can piss me off - fast - if in \\'the moment\\' of grief. My dad died young. I\\'m not sure I find that sentence comforting \\'at all\\'! Justine- As unfair as I felt she was \\'emotionally\\' loved by her mother- Meggie...she was my least favorite character in the book too. And... for no real reason - she didn\\'t do anything wrong --( I did like her relationship with her brother) -- but I was too interested in other characters, more. I could go on and on and on.....It\\'s filled with drama, tabu themes, forbidden love, angst, secrets, love, family, marriage, illness, death, loyalty, money, religion, sex, - heartbreaking and affirmative... gorgeously written - master-storytelling!! Thanks for all the - many friends here who encouraged me to read this!! I\\'m thrilled I did!!!',\n",

Hmph.This story lifted my heart and made my soul come alive. I felt as if the characters ingratiated themselves to such an extent in my very being, that I had sensations of them dancing upon my soul.

       "    '\\u200f\\u202b\\u202dThe Thorn Birds is a 1977 best-selling novel by the Australian author Colleen McCullough. Set primarily on Drogheda—a fictional sheep station in the Australian Outback named after Drogheda, Ireland—the story focuses on the Cleary family and spans the years 1915 to 1969. The novel is the best selling book in Australian history, and has sold over 33 million copies worldwide. Meghann \"Meggie\" Cleary, a four-year-old girl living in New Zealand in the early twentieth century, is the only daughter of Paddy, an Irish farm labourer and Fee, his harassed but aristocratic wife. Meggie is a beautiful child with curly red-gold hair but receives little coddling and must struggle to hold her own. Her favourite brother is the eldest, Frank, a rebellious young man who is unwillingly preparing himself for the blacksmith\\'s trade. He is much shorter than his other brothers, but very strong. Unlike the other Clearys, he has black hair and eyes, believed to be inherited from his Maori great-great-grandmother. ...عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «م\\u200dرغ\\u200dان\\u200c ش\\u200dاخ\\u200dس\\u200dار طرب\\u200c»؛ «آخ\\u200dری\\u200dن\\u200c پ\\u200dرن\\u200dده\\u200c در ش\\u200dاخ\\u200dه\\u200c ای\\u200c ت\\u200dن\\u200dه\\u200dا»؛ «آخ\\u200dری\\u200dن\\u200c پ\\u200dرن\\u200dده\\u200c»؛ «پرنده خارزار»؛ «مرغان خارزار»؛ و «م\\u200dرغ\\u200c خ\\u200dار»؛ نویسنده: کالین مک کالو؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش: ماه نوامبر سال 2006میلادیعنوان: مرغان شاخسار طرب، نویسنده: کالین مک کالو؛ مترجم: فرشته طاهری؛ تهران، انتشارات ویس؛ 1367؛ در 791ص؛ چاپ دوم 1368؛ سوم سال 1369؛ بعدا نشر درسا)؛ موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان استرالیا - سده 20معنوان: مرغ خار، نویسنده: کالین مک کالو؛ مترجم: طاهره صدیقیان-رویا صدوقی، نشر مروارید 1369؛ در 368ص؛عنوان: پرنده خارزار، نویسنده: کالین مک کالو؛ مترجم: مهدی غبرایی، نشر نیلوفر 1371؛ در 764ص؛عنوان: پرندگان خارزار، نویسنده: کالین مک کالو؛ مترجم: امیر راسترو، نشر قصه پرداز 1379؛ در 568ص؛عنوان: مرغان شاخسار طرب، نویسنده: کالین مک کالو؛ مترجم: تیمور قادری- زهرا قادری، نشر ابرسفید 1391؛ در 736ص؛در پهنه ی گیتی مرغکی است که تنها یکبار در زندگی خویش آواز میخواند؛ آوایی دلنشینتر از آواز هر مخلوق دیگری در گستره خاک؛ از آن دم که ترک آشیانه میگوید خاربنی را میجوید، و تا آن را نیابد، آرام نمیگیرد؛ چو آن را یافت، در میان شاخسار گزنده مینشیند و میخواند، و خود را بر فراز بلندترین و تیزترین شاخه ی خار مصلوب میکند، و در واپسین لحظه های زندگی در سوگ خویش بلند آوازتر از بلبل و چکاوک نغمه سرایی میکندداستان دختری به نام «مگی» است که عاشق کشیشی به نام «رالف» می\\u200cشود و در اثر یک رابطه جنسی از «رالف» پسری به دنیا می\\u200cآورد؛ کتاب «پرنده خارزار»، داستان سه نسل از خانواده ی «کلیریس» را باز میگوید؛ گله دارانی که از سرزمینی زیبا و سرسخت، زندگی طلب میکنند و همزمان با دلخوریها، ضعفها و اسراری روبرو میگردند که به خانواده شان نیز راه مییابدتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 19/07/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 13/06/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی',\n",
       "    'This beaut of a soap opera has been around for decades & for excellent reason. Epics have been forgotten & currently authors satisfy their readers (or not, as the case may be) with smaller stories & smaller lives.McCullough has the tenacity to include three generations in this sprawling saga, and as family portraits usually tell of differences between the generations PLUS the ties that bind them together & to a home, this one exactly does that in an extremely entertaining fashion.Fee marries her second choice, not the man of her dreams, and becomes pregnant with more or less the number of digits one has in both hands; she lives a quiet & ironically isolationist existence. Her daughter Meggie, the protagonist until her daughter takes the helm, also suffers her mother\\'s character flaws... fate plus genes a maudling story make. Her priest Ralph, in what is the central love story, chooses God over his heart. The same is not repeated but is indeed echoed in the last generation as Justine, who finally breaks the curse, leaves the warmth and monotony of her family in Drogheda to actually take flight & follow her instincts which had failed the Cleary women in the past.There are only 19 chapters in this massive chronology and many events occur, mostly random and sometimes poetic, but they never fail to surprise. There are so many characters, & all of them, you feel, actually employ humanity, act like actual persons that may have lived. There are acts of stupidity and compassion. People repress many feelings, more for personal convictions than for social or familial obligations we seldom don\\'t visit in books such as these!Ralph is an idiot for causing so much pain to both he and his love. What does that say about organized religion and the crimson-clothed of the almighty Vatican? The Clearys, though not intelligent mainly because of the collective \"Irish pauper\" mentality the patriarchal figure bestows upon his offspring (Papa Cleary and Ralph\\'s proxy, Luke pretty much F*** things up for the rest). They are, however, extremely hard workers and this pays off well. There are many morals, many moments of euphoria, and even slight (by today\\'s standards) snippets of hot erotica! You pretty much stand witness to one of the most complex yet endearing pieces of literature.Highlights: 1) the death of one of the Cleary boy\\'s via warthog asphyxiation immediately following the death of his father via fiery \"holocaust.\" 2) Ralph meeting his love at her retreat where she is in isolation is definately one of the most romantic notions I have ever read... it is written with the finest sense of what love really is. 3) learning what \"French Letters\" mean. 4) transition from New Zealand to Australia to Rome, Greece, London. Such sprawls indicate that life can expand from its moldy origins to experience infinite possiblities, arrive at distal ends.I recommend this book for someone not afraid to having a two-three week relationship with a soap opera that, unlike those on t.v., does not insult the audience with romantic cliches or expected \"disasters.\" The novel is organic: a testament of lives that experience pain and pleasure. The reader only experiences the latter.',\n",

       "    \"Emily Dickinson is one of my favourite poets; she is the gothic queen of poetry. At times she strongly reminds me of Edgar Allan Poe. Her poems are less macabre than Poe’s and certainly less fantastical, focusing more on human perception of the darkness and the realities of life, but her work is undoubtedly on par with his in the vein of dark romanticism. There’s just something exceedingly morose about the way in which she writes. She was terribly depressed for much of her life, and such a pessimistic attitude to life can be seen within her writing. These are the words of a woman completely disillusion with the human experience; there is little light in these poems. Humans are portrayed as weak and self-destructive; they are at times evil and even hellish in nature. All depictions are typically one sided with the darkness conquering any sense of hope. If anything hope is dead within her words. There is only one thing we are striving for in life, and that’s the end according to such thinking. Read enough of Dickinson’s poetry and you will see how obsessed with death she is; it a recurring theme across her work, one she brings up time and time again. She spent most of her life in solitude so it’s no surprise that she came up with poetry so dark in content; she had a miserable life, and it reflects in the nature of her writing: The words feel calm and almost serene, as the speaker is accepting of her mortality. She establishes the idea that death is not a choice; it just happens like life just happens. So we should just sit back and enjoy the ride, as she does in Death’s carriage. It passes through the surrounding scenery at a slow pace and observes children playing near wide open fields. This is indicative of the fact that death will come for everyone: there’s no escaping it. The speaker is only half dressed, which suggest that nobody is truly ever ready for death; it comes when it will come never mind how unprepared you are. Death waits for no man. Death is personified as a gentleman here, one who will escort her to the afterlife. Death, to Dickinson, is not the end; it is the road to immortality: the beginning. Indeed, at the end of the poem she reveals she has actually been dead for centuries (shock-horror!) We’re left with the lingering image of dead horses perpetually pushing her forward into eternity. It’s a wonderful poem, dark and gripping, ethereal and enchanting. Of all of Dickinson’s poetry, this is the one that sticks with me. Years after I first read it, I still hear the opening lines. She also characterises God as a reckless and almost careless deity. He is not the ideal that many perceive him to be. At the moment of death he fumbles at your soul; you are not elevated or taken to heaven, but “stunned” and “scalped” in the process, then struck like a “thunderbolt.” God has paws which make him sound animalistic and beastlike; he is not kind and forgiving. Death is not the end, but it doesn’t have to be a glamourous experience. Indeed, in another poem the speaker is transfixed by the buzzing of a fly as she lies on her death bed. It’s the last thing she hears; it’s her last experience on earth. In this, it abandons all glorified religious imagery, and almost portrays an ironically realistic moment. She further hints that faith only works for those that are truly devout. If you don’t really believe in it, then calling upon God’s name is pointless. She suggests that those people should look to science for the answers rather than a false bastion they don’t really believe in. Dickinson is my idea of the perfect poet. She is a religious sceptic, but she is not dismissive of a possible truth in religion. Her poetry dances between opposing ideas and it doesn’t suggest truth in either of them; thus, it is open to interpretation and debate. It can be read in different ways and through this it is profound, powerful and utterly beautiful. I love her unique style, though she’s not one that’s going to leave you feeling uplifted after reading her work that's for sure.\",\n",

       "    ' She described my needs with beauty and accuracy. That is all I need. A book. And coffee. And maybe something to eat. But mostly a book.Last weekend (weekends; the only time I can read like a maniac and write some things), I put on hold all my currently-reading books and dedicated myself to poetry. A GR friend mentioned Dickinson the other day and I remembered reading a couple of poems and a bit about her reclusive, haunted-by-death life. But I didn\\'t know her, at all. Still, I am not sure I know her now. There are so many aspects to consider. If I had to choose one word to describe her, I couldn\\'t; I would need hundreds of them. She contains multitudes, as another poet said. She seems so simple. But there is a beautiful, bittersweet complexity in her quietness. I found  and, to be honest, I was quite intimidated. So instead, I chose a \"Selected Poems\" collection. But I will definitely read that first one, entirely, someday. I only read its footnotes related to the poems I read.There are so many poems that I loved. And so many variations too. I am not going to discuss the fact that some of her poems were rewritten in order to fit the conventional rhyme of her time (atrocious). But I will mention that some of them were written in different ways by the poet herself. For example, this one that is now so close to my heart.That poem was written in 1859. There is another one written in 1862. Although the text is the same, the structure is not. Plus, a dozen of dashes and her weird capitalization. Anyway, the poem is absolutely beautiful. Poignantly beautiful. There is a person who never succeeded, a loser, and Dickinson wisely tells us that he really understands the idea of success. The person who lacks something, clearly wants that , he longs for it, and is able to get to know it so well because... he cannot touch it. He knows it better that the one who actually possesses it. In this case, success, victory. A poem I truly identify with. In conclusion, the loser acquired an unpleasant knowledge, one that stayed with him until his death. I remember a line of a song that I never listened to, saying that there is no worse nostalgia than to yearn for what never happened or never existed. An almost never-ending sorrow, a usually identifiable cause and an apparently nonexistent solution. Silver lining? You can\\'t lose what you never had. (Worst “silver lining” ever).Another one:A 1890 poem that seems to reflect Dickinson\\'s kind nature. Inspiring verses that are trying to help us find some meaning in our lives. Something that can be found when we help others. I am not sure how helpful you can be while living inside your room and not even talking to people to their faces, but at least she wrote about it...? Her poetry might have been the best and maybe the only way she had to help others.It is quite a positive poem, considering Death is one of her most recurring themes. Just to name a few: \"If I should die\", \"If I shouldn\\'t be alive\", \"Death is like the insect\", \"Because I could not stop for Death\" (one of her most well-known poems and the first one I\\'ve ever read).But I am not focusing on that theme. Enough has been said. I found other poems that are now stuck in my head. Dickinson captivated me. She gave me a new perspective on poetry. If I could describe all these feelings her work has created in me, I would feel such a huge relief; I can\\'t, though. So I must borrow some of her words: \"If I read a book [and] it makes my whole body so cold no fire ever can warm me, I know  is poetry. If I feel physically as if the top of my head were taken off, I know  is poetry.\"March 2, 2014?* Also on .',\n",

       "   'Review': ['I didn\\'t see the film so I came fresh to the book. It had a lot of impact on me because I have been in a small boat, a 34\\' catamaran in a 4 day storm out in the Atlantic before Brazil. It wasn\\'t a \\'perfect storm\\' but it was still rough, with huge seas and a constant exhausting beating against the wind. It prevented us going into , our next stop, we couldn set a course for the archipelago at all. So I could not just see but feel what a difficult position they were in. I know quite a bit about sword-fishing. I\\'ve read \\'s books. An aside - there are very few countries and vessels in the world where a woman would have the opportunity to swordfish let alone be a captain. It is an extremely physical job, setting hooks and squid bait, on spooled longlines hat run for miles and rip your fingers. The hooks are so big they could rip right through a man\\'s palm if the spool should run on. Then there is the killing of the swordfish when hauled in, gutting and icing them. As well as directing the crew, a hard-drinking group of macho men, maintaining the boat, it\\'s structure, mechanics and electronics. The electronics, depth sounders, radar and the like are not just for navigation but crucial in working out where the fish are. This was Linda\\'s strength, this finding the schools of swordfish. Not only was Greenlaw one of an infintessimally small number of women swordfishing, but she was the most successful captain of all time. Where the normal catch is 1 ton a day, for seven days straight she hauled in 5 tons each day. The money from the catch on a boat is 50% to the owner, then the expenses are taken off and a set formula applied to the rest where the captain takes the most and the newest deckhand the least. That month the deckhand took home $10,000.How do I know about swordfishing? My ex-husband was Chief Fisheries Officer and used to supervise the boats that came to fish in our waters. Because the permits they bought were limited in what they could do and the by catch could not be sold, a local would always be on the boat with them, sometimes my ex. It was all quite fascinating.Swordfish have a long, barbed extension to their jaw that is both a weapon of attack and used to slash prey fish to weaken them. When they are hauled on board alive, they are very brave and will attack to the last. They can kill a man, or almost as bad, a wound from the sword will almost always become infected and the boat might be very far in distance and time from home. There are always by-catch pulled up with the swordfish. There are the tuna. If you\\'ve only seen one dead held aloft by a fisherman it\\'s as if you\\'d only ever seen a rose browned with frost and never in it\\'s full bloom. Sailing across the ocean, three Atlantic blue fin tuna, each about 15\\' swam in front of the boat maintaining an exact distance for more than hour. They were gorgeous, a rainbow of shimmering colours like sunlight on oil, like just beneath the surface. But the tuna aren\\'t a problem, they are gutted and thrown on to the ice along with the swordfish - generally a perk of the fishermen, the boat owner doesn\\'t get a share of by-catch. The problem is the live sharks pulled up. They are vicious and their carcass is dangerous. It alone will rip the skin from a man. It\\'s not smooth, it\\'s not even sandpaper-like, it\\'s actually covered in tiny teeth, denticles. Sharks have to be shot as they being pulled up. The fishermen sometimes take the teeth as mementos and to sell. The flesh has to be thrown overboard immediately before it spoils and stinks of ammonia, piss. If shark is bled within minutes of being caught, and then iced, it is delicious. It\\'s a firm, white fish with a mild flavour. Very nice deep fried in the Trinidadian style of  with chives, thyme, garlic and hot peppers.The book was a blow-by-blow account of the storm and how it affected the crew, their family on shore, and the boat, Andrea Gale, Linda Greenlaw\\'s sister ship. Linda\\'s boat was the Hannah Boden, both owned by Alden Leeman. The boat foundered amidst terrible seas and all crew were lost and never found. It was a harrowing story, and because I knew the subject so well, I lived through it and felt it and it upset me a great deal. The author, Sebastian Junger, has that power to bring you into the story and involve you. I did enjoy it, but perhaps not in quite the way one usually uses the word \"enjoy\".',\n",
       "    '-- William Langewiesche,  On October 28, 1991, the fishing vessel  and her crew of six men disappeared off the Grand Banks in a tremendous storm created by...etc., etc. By now, everyone knows the story of this ill-fated little boat, her tiny crew, and the massive storm that swallowed them whole. The book was a bestseller the instant it came out. A blockbuster movie followed. The phrase \"a perfect storm\" is the most-overused shorthand phrase in our culture (for awhile I thought it might be overtaken by \"Wall Street verses Main Street,\" but alas, the election is over, and storms without imperfection are back in vogue). Once upon a time, though, before George Clooney grew a great beard and drove his boat up a mountain-sized CGI wave,  was simply a sharp bit of journalism. Sebastian Junger found a newspaper clipping about the \\'s fate, went to Gloucester with pen and pad, and delved into the lives of her crew, entering a normally taciturn and reticent community to show us their lives before their deaths. (It\\'s worth remembering that Junger\\'s book came out long before the History Channel abdicated it\\'s purported mission to bring us  and  and before the Discovery Channel presented  and  and yes, . Nowadays, celebration of blue-collar life is a cultural norm; it wasn\\'t always that way). Almost from the first sentences, Junger - who has now morphed into a semi-self-righteous, self-styled Homer of Afghanistan - shows he has an excellent grasp of place: The Discovery Channel\\'s  - of which I am a huge fan - has turned a spotlight on the lives of fishermen. We see these grizzled tough guys in all their rotgut swilling, chain-smoking, foul-mouthed glory. At the time this was written, though, Junger\\'s work was revelatory. He presented them as iconoclasts; men who lived entirely in moments. They could go out on a boat for a couple of weeks, make a big score, blow thousands of dollars in a couple days, and go right back out on the ocean to do it again. Junger finds a way to celebrate these lives without neglecting the broken marriages, child support orders, and limited windows within which these men could succeed. After introducing us to the doomed - Billy Tyne, Michael Moran, Dale Murphy, Alfred Pierre, Bobby Shatford, and David Sullivan - Junger sets out to sea. This is where things could have gotten very tricky. See, very little is known about what happened to the . There were no survivors. No mayday calls. The EPIRBs never activated. Attempts to locate the wreckage on the ocean floor have so far failed. All we have is an empty ocean and miles to fill with supposition. There are only two ways to write this story. First, Junger could have accepted he did not have enough material for a book, and allowed this tale to remain as a long-form article, which is how it began (the article is called , published in  magazine). Or two, he could write a book in which the central event can only be hypothesized. Junger chose the latter, and having read many disaster books since, I can see he chose a route fraught with peril (relative to the craft of writing, of course). With so little upon which to hang the central narrative, Junger has no choice but to pad the book with digressions and to shift the story away from the  and to other, luckier boats caught in the storm. Done poorly, this tact would have left me resentful that I\\'d been sold a bill of goods. Somehow, though, he pulls it off. This is kind of a surprise. Something about Sebastian Junger just calls out to be disliked. Maybe it\\'s his chiseled jaw, perfectly symmetrical face, and artfully cultivated five o\\'clock shadow. Maybe it\\'s the scent of young-French-nobleman that he gives off; a willingness to thrust himself into new worlds with both curiosity and entitlement (this is, unfortunately, a strong undercurrent in his flat collection of stories entitled , a book notable today for a cameo made by former Northern Alliance leader Ahmad Massoud, whose assassination by al Qaida was prepatory to the 9/11 attacks). Junger is both everyman and know-it-all. He can swill Wild Turkey while still cogitating on fluid dynamics, long-line fishing, and the science of drowning. There’s a whiff of Cliff Clavin about him, sitting at the end of the bar, half in the bag, telling all the neighborhood drunks that their deeply held views about Afghanistan are ill-conceived. Except unlike Cliff, Junger is probably right, which makes him a little less likeable. His saving grace is his ability to write. Like the best journalists, Junger writes clearly, includes telling details, and manages to convey difficult concepts - like the physics of waves - in a way that makes you feel better because you can understand them. He also knows all the emotional beats, and hits every one. Junger intuits just where to place a single, short sentence such as \"no one got off alive\" in order to induce chills. For instance, I\\'ve never forgotten the section of  that tells you how someone drowns:Theories about what happened to the , no matter how well-reasoned and detailed, could not have supported  in book-length. There needed to be a B-story. Here, Junger chooses to highlight the heroics and plight of the Coast Guard\\'s parajumpers, an elite squad of the best swimmers on Earth (and also the subject of the Kevin Costner vehicle, , which despite Ashton Kutcher\\'s presence, is not nearly as bad as you think). These parts of the book are tense, white-knuckled, and agonizing, since unlike the foreordained fate of the \\'s crew, you have no idea who is going to live and who is going to die.  is one of my favorite books. It is, as the subheading announces, a story of men against the sea. In other words, it\\'s a sea yarn (perhaps my favorite yarn genre), and Junger is a great raconteur. He pulls together a number of different threads - science, literature, the Bible, various sea stories - to form a single, powerful piece. It is a bit of audaciousness that pays off. As I read this, I pictured Junger as my narrator, my own personal Marlow, wearing a flannel shirt and sitting at the end of a dark Gloucester bar with smoke-stained walls and a swordfish hung over the fireplace. He strokes his perfect stubble while sipping Scotch neat. Outside, an autumn gale is raging, pelting the windows with rain. In the distance, a foghorn sounds mournfully. Junger begins to speak in his gruff-yet-Wesleyan-educated voice. The story is about men who go out in boats, and about the seemingly-infinite sea, which - like the Universe - never ceases to awe, no matter how small the rest of the world gets; the story tells of the power of waves and the dark spray-swept terror and the loneliness of death and the men out on the ocean who vanish, and whose lives are memories and whose deaths are mysteries.',\n",
       "    '“How do men act on a sinking ship? Do they hold each other? Do they pass around the whisky? Do they cry?” October 1991 - It was \"the perfect storm\"Most of us have seen the movie. I have watched it many times and was inspired to read this book for a reading challenge. I found it to be well written, thoughtful, educational, moving and heart breaking. The amount of research that went into the writing of this book is impressive. Junger did his homework and it shows. If you are expecting the book to be like the movie you watched, you will be a little disappointed. This book not only introduces you to the doomed men who set sail on the Andrea Gail, it also tells the story of other boaters, their near misses, a helicopter going down, rescues, the dangers of hurricanes, the ships that sunk and the dangers of fishing.\"Fishing continues to be one of the easiest ways in which to die while earning a paycheck.\"This book also educates the reader on swordfish fishing, weather reports, wave heights, the equipment on the Andrea Gail, rogue waves, missing ships, and what happens in your body when you drown. Some may find the beginning of the book to be a little dry, but I was fascinated with it. Who knew I found fishing and boats so interesting? Plus, he is giving us a glimpse into the life of the crew. It also feels weird to say that I enjoyed this book which dealt with tragedy. I thought it was very well done and told the story of known things that occurred when the crew and their boat went missing. We know that the crew did not survive. Junger cannot tell us what happened on the Andrea Gail during the storm, but he does give a good account of what happened before, after and what others reported experiencing during the storm. \"Whatever it is, one thing is know for sure.

       "    'This is a powerful and heart-wrenching true story. Many people are familiar with the movie – I saw it at the theater when it first came out in 2000. But, it wasn’t until now that I finally read it.It is the story of many different people and how they were affected by the Perfect Storm (also known as The No-Name Storm and the Halloween Gale) in the North Atlantic during Halloween week in 1991. The primary story follows the crew of the Andrea Gail:The early part of the book is reminiscent of Moby Dick as you learn the ins and outs of sword fishing. During this point it runs a fine line between being fascinating or dragging. Luckily, it is nowhere near as long as Moby Dick so it serves as a nice introduction to the atmosphere of the story.Then the storm hits:During the storm part of the book there are several tales of heroic rescues and tragic losses. While the focus at first is on the Andrea Gail, there are many other interesting stories from the North Atlantic.If you like non-fiction, harrowing tales of nature’s wrath, and stories about people pushed to the very limits of endurance, then I highly recommend this book. Just be sure to bring along your Dramamine! ',\n",
       "    'This is the heartbreaking true account of the last moments of those aboard the fateful last voyage of the Andrea Gail, the swordfish boat caught in the heart of the ocean during one of the worst storms to hit the North American eastern seaboard, in October 1991.This book was more of a factual account, attempting to recreate the last days and the possible thoughts and actions of those who sadly lost their lives, rather than an attempt to fictionalize their story. Junger never lets his reader forget that this is a true-life description; achieving this with passages from meteorologists, other fishermen and the loved ones left to mourn those lost at sea. Whilst being dense in the science of storms and the process of life on board a fishing schooner, it is also thick with tragedy and truly does justice to the lost men who can now never be forgotten.'],\n",

       "   'Review': ['Poor Malachy McCourt. When his book came out, the critics said, “He’s not Frank.” Goodreads reviewers echoed the same sentiment. But I don’t think there was much rivalry between them. They shared their fame the same way they pooled money to bring their younger brothers and mother over to the States. Their first writing project was a collaboration - a two-man play I haven’t read yet. And then came the books, which include some interesting overlaps. Malachy depicts Frank as a real gentleman, which comes across in Frank’s own books and the interviews available on Youtube. Frank depicts the child Malachy as a “dote” who could charm any roomful of people and the life of every party in adulthood. That outgoingness  comes across in this book, and also, in any interview with Malachy you might want to catch on Youtube.So it’s true that this book does not have the literary grace of Frank’s books, but my gosh, it’s funny! It’s also a bit ribald; Malachy tells you all about “sampling the fleshpots” in his travels from India to Europe. For that reason, I should probably put it on my “Regrettable Reads” shelf, but I can’t regret anything that made me laugh that hard. Frank’s books also made me laugh hard, but not as much as this. The man who drives me to work wondered, “What are you reading back there?” So I’m definitely looking forward to the resolution of Malachy’s story with his next memoir: how he got sober and lived happily ever after.',\n",
       "    \"If you can find any interest into Malachy McCourt's endless pursuit for drinking, promiscuity and living a full-fledged hedonistic lifestyle, then this is the book for you.Beyond that, he only demonstrates how reprehensibly immoral he is with respect to his treatment of marriage, and more so his dedication to his children. If there is any redemption to be attained on his part, he certainly does not make any case for it.Yes, the book begins off comically, recounting stories of how he arrives to America and the trials and tribulations that ensue. In the early stages of the book, the stage is potentially set for an unfolding of important events and thus insight or life lessons, ingredients that would suit a memoir-type novel appropriately.As far as I could tell, what follows for the final 250 pages is a continuous reminder of how much of a sot Malachy was, even though it does prove destructive towards his familial affairs. This as much is even acknowledged by Malachy, though it may only be in retrospect.If this story provides 'true' accounts and anecdotes of Malachy's life, then it is fair enough to spare any criticism towards lack of plot. That being said, to maintain (at least my) interest, there must be some strategy and compulsion to engage the reader for the long haul. I found none. Rather, I tried to find some comedy in the telling of his stories, and kept optimistic that there would be a valuable lesson or perhaps some epiphany on Malachy's part from his lifelong moral transgressions.Not likely.Just as Malachy liked to imbibe and 'dip the wick' to his fulfillment, this book just seems to be an opportunity to bask in his conceit, using his childhood misfortunes as blame for his moral degradation.I give this review 2 stars because he does provide some momentary humour, and he uses the English language in a creative way to describe situations and express himself.Beyond this, I have even less respect or admiration for Malachy McCourt than before I had read this.I'm not sure whether that was his intention.P.S. I am Irish-Canadian, not too different from the ancestral background of Malachy, and I find it is quite unnecessary to perpetuate the stereotype of Irishmen as being disgraceful drunks and morons. Didn't his brother Frank McCourt already profit enough of this exploit in his series of novels before this one? (e.g. Angela's Ashes, 'Tis, etc.)\",\n",
       "    '\"Hastily, I transferred the snow to the burning part of the mattress and extinguished it, I thought, but an hour or so after I went back to sleep, the smoke revisited me. Bounding out of the bed again, I went for a jug of water and sloshed it all over the spifflicated Paterson. The man hardly stirred, but my mission was complete : Fire Out! and back to bed.Sometime later I was awakened abruptly and rudely by a rough hand shaking and thumping me. When I opened my eyes to see who it was that had the temerity to behave thusly, I almost had the cardiac seizure. I saw a head crowned wit spikes of ice, icily protruding eyebrows and eyelashes, icicled dripping from the nose. In a very high, indignant voice, the arctic apparition informed me that he was nearly frozen to death. Never in his life had he been subjected to such a horrible place, and he was leaving, and there was no point in trying to stop him.\"\"In Zurich… Everything was neat and symmetrical and orderly, and not a thing in sight to disturb the color scheme. Flowers, shrubs, and plants all clipped and leaning in unison to the direction of the unseen hand. There were people washing and hosing pavements, cleaning windows, polishing bells, painting walls, and generally doing violence to the natural orders of things. A weed poking its cheery little head up through a crack in a footpath would be cause for mobilization of the Swiss Army and their knives.\"This book is the memoirs of Malachy McCourt, who I’d never heard of before I read this book. His brother is the author of Anglela’s Ashes, which I have not read.A lot of this book was funny, really really funny. But then the rest was just his sad and slightly pathetic existence of drinking and making an ass of himself. It was the drunken tales of an alcoholic. The end was him screaming at his Father for being a drunk that abandoned his family, yet really, it was the same thing he had done. And that was it. It never went on to say if he became a good father - you know, one that didn’t leave the country for months on end, and didn’t spend every penny he had on the sauce, or ever got his shit together.So beside some of the funny scenes, the beginning romanticized alcoholism, and the end was incomplete. Maybe that\\'s because it was a memoir and he wasn\\'t dead. Who knows.',\n",

That isn't reason to give this book a 2 star rating though.The rating is because the book is a shallow account of a shallow man who in writing this book is a name dropping account of his tenuous stardom.The book started of well enough; McCourt can be a very clever writer but it just got so egotistical- how many women he could and did sleep with, how many drinks he could and did drink. how many people he could and did swear at, how many well known people he could and did insult. His writing ability deserved better than thisThe best of the book is to be read in the last part five- Father to the Man. It is heartbreaking and so well written.

       "   'Review': ['I’ve been a registered Democrat since high school and many of my values are liberal, but this was awful. This book is an example of atrocious holier-than-thou thinking, with humor that is meaner than it is funny, and blind where it should be practical. It’s propaganda for people who already believe the cause and contributes nothing to discussion. It’s every bit as spiteful and unreasonable to its opposition as the vilified super-conservatives. It makes me wonder if people like Franken and Ann Coulter aren’t in this for money, as championship of polar values gets them easy praise and tons of cash. I found the epilogue, about the Democrats taking Congress and righting all the wrongs of the country to be the most amusing part of the book. When we actually saw how little the Democratic Congress (which I helped with my vote into office) did, it was like one final nail, heavier than all the others, driven through this paperback. Now that they control the presidency and both houses of Congress, with Franken in their company, maybe some of his righteous prophecy can come true. Until then, do yourself a favor and pick up an informative book like  or  instead, books intended to give you information so you can form your own opinions. Mean spirited humor meant to demean those we disagree with only hurts national discourse, no matter which “other” is being attacked.',\n",
       "    '\"Grown-up love means actually understanding what you love, taking the good with the bad and helping your loved one grow.” ― Al Franken, Lies & the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair & Balanced Look at the Right4.5 stars.I guess one\\'s enjoyment of this depends on how much they like Al Franken.This was the first book I’ve read by him and I found it to be a warm, human and utterly hilarious read. Al takes on FOX News in this this book, in particular Bill O’Reilly.This book has a very interesting back story as supposedly Fox News sued Franken in court over the words \"Fair and Balanced\" which I find to be utterly hysterical. And yes it is discussed in the book. I suppose I can see why conservatives might get pissed off at this book but even if you’re not an ultra liberal this does make for fun reading. Franken brings up a lot of things that are really on point. George Bush was president when this came out. Franken brings his wit through the book, to be sure, but the thing is: lots of stuff in this book make so much sense. I loved his \"Lawyer and the waitress\" story.I personally love reading political nonfiction books to get all viewpoints and I happen to be a fan of Franken. If you are seeking a good political Non Fiction book, this is a great one AND there is nothing about Trump because he was a long way from being president when this came out. (Sigh..resisting the urge to say something Snarky about now).Whatever your views on Franken, he is not and never has been, boring. And he just makes one laugh while at the same time making you think. I would give this 4.5 stars. Highly recommended.',\n",
       "    \"I would recommend this book to intellectual conservatives so that they simply have more ammo to disassociate themselves from the neo-cons. I actually respect true conservative thought and this administration was not it. At all. And Franken gives a funny, sometimes enraging, flogging of the neo-con media.It's a great book. I think, however, it preaches to the choir since the person who would read this is a liberal to begin with in the first place.And he DESTROYS Ann Coulter and Bill O'Reilly...this, in and of itself, are good things...\",\n",
       "    'This very funny but extremely serious book goes after the deliberate falsehoods perpetrated by the right-wing on \"liberals.\"As you may know, the Fox Network went after Franken for trademark infringement because he used the phrase \"fair and balanced.\" The judge threw out the suit as completely ludicrous and made several trenchant comments about the inability of the Fox executives to recognize satire when they saw it.Harvard University gave Franken a fellowship to basically do whatever he wanted, but demurred at his idea of having Harvard students write his son\\'s college application. Franken finally hit upon the idea of having a group of students do research for his book. They bought the idea.His first target is Ann Coulter, author of Scandal. Franken methodically picks apart her book, revealing it for the inaccurate, if not disingenuous, piece of nonsense it is. He also shows how she has blatantly lied about things. Her Connecticut driver\\'s license shows her birth date as 1961; her Washington DL says 1963. She claims the Washington DL is correct, which means she voted as a sixteen-year-old. On one of the applications she lied about her age. Now, many people have done that, but since the US Patriot Act makes it a felony to put false information on a government ID, she could be whisked away and held without counsel for a long time. I wish they would. Simple charges she makes in her book were never checked. For example, she complains that Evan Thomas, supposedly one of those heinous liberals, was the son of Norman Thomas, four-time [sic:] candidate for president on the Socialist party ticket. Actually, he ran six times, and a simple phone call to Evan Thomas reveals that he is not the son of Norman Thomas. Coulter\\'s book is filled with such false details. Either she is extremely lazy or a blatant liar. Franken obviously suspects the latter.Francken has infuriated that scion of right-wing Fox Bill O\\'Reilly by publicly pointing out many untruths that O\\'Reilly has put forth. At Book Expo in Los Angeles, O\\'Reilly was humiliated by Franken, who categorically listed all sorts of lies O\\'Reilly had perpetrated on the public. Now, Franken makes clear that occasionally making a mistake on a statistic is hardly a crime, but O\\'Reilly\\'s customary tactic, when challenged with the correct information from unimpeachable sources is to simply bully and yell at his challenger rather than correct the mistake. The problem is also that he makes lots of mistakes. More from the \"sewer of right-wing dishonesty. When he interviewed the son of a worker killed on 9/11 on February 4th, 2003, he became enraged at the son\\'s opposition to the war in Iraq, had his engineer cut off the man\\'s microphone, and sent him packing saying to him after the show\\'s end, \"Get out of my studio before I tear you to f*cking pieces.\"O\\'Reilly, who constantly rails at the lyrics of rap songs, wrote a murder mystery in 1998, Those who Trespass (about a serial killer who murders everyone who interferes with his rising television career), that took explicit sex and violence to new heights and the English language to new lows. In one murder, the victim is killed by having a spoon driven through the roof of her mouth into her brain stem. Variants of the \"F\" word and \"B\" word are used more than 51 times. Case of the pot calling the kettle black? O\\'Reilly is not a nice man.Team Franken took a look at Hannity\\'s (of Hannity and Colmes,) book to verify the factualness of his statements. Examples of disingenuousness and dishonesty abound.Bush\\'s initial indifference to al Qaeda prior to 9/11 is astonishing. The Clinton administration had developed plans for eliminating Bin Laden, but those plans were ignored. That the Bin Laden family were good friends with the Bush family is well-known, and Franken speculates as to what might have happened to Clinton had he been so nice to the Bin Laden family, permitting a Saudi plane to fly around the country picking up family members for return to Saudi Arabia, while American airplanes were grounded. In the meantime, President Bush has broken all presidential records for the number of days spent on vacation.The book is often uneven, some parts funnier and some more serious. Should one laugh or cry learning that many of our leaders today, Cheney, Wolfowitz, Perle, Bush, and other chickenhawks who are sending men off to die in war, did everything in their power, having their fathers pull strings and inventing flimsy excuses (shouldn\\'t pick on Limbaugh, I think he was just too fat) to avoid service in Vietnam. ',\n",
       "    'Why I love this book: 1) Definitely one of the funniest book titles I\\'ve ever seen2) Remember when, for years after 9/11, so many media and entertainment figures held themselves back from criticizing Bush administration? Al broke the silence quite a bit with this book, which was basically a \"bullshit\" cry heard \\'round the country. After that it seemed to be way more ok for others to start speaking out. You may think he\\'s too moderate but he\\'s pretty clever at calling bullshit on the right.3) There was some really hilarious controversy surrounding this book when it came out. Bill O\\'Reilly got in a fight with Al over this book in a heated exchange at a major Book Expo. The details of this fight are hilarious. Also Fox tried to SUE him for using the \"fair and balanced\" phrase in his subtitle. What happened is, the judge told the Fox representatives in court that the were full of shit and in over their heads and the case was I think literally laughed out of court4) His sense of humor is very unique '],\n",

Palast is Jewish and comes from the left so while you get good exposures of corporate shenanigans you also have to put up with the typical hypocritical anti-white snipes that comes from that demographic. Like at one point Palast mocks a cab driver that is worried about too many immigrants coming into England and says he wants to preserve his English culture and heritage. Palast then equates English culture with drunken football hoologanism and says that the English should be begging to add new material to their gene pool! So for all the good work he has done Palast can\\'t seem to shake the Jewish leftist tendency to hate working class whites. If it wasn\\'t for that I may have given this book five stars.',\n",

He brings his investigative experience from these organizations to uncover greed, avarice, and injustice the world over. He is probably most well know for uncovering the voting shenanigans in Florida during the last election, which makes of the first chapter of this book. His documentation is meticulous, and his style is straight forward and to the point.He takes on the Bush family and the corporations (i.e. Enron) and countries (i.e. Saudi Arabia) that have supported them throughout their political lives. He also has a lot to say about deregulation of power, which has significant relevance in light of the recent blackout in the northeast. He also shows how the IMF, World Bank, and WTO have had a negative impact on developing economies and challenges the globalization. Of course he devotes a full chapter to corporate America. In another chapter, he goes after Pat Robertson and Pepsi Cola among others.Furthermore he provides a handy appendix for \"your turn-resources for action.\" In that section he lists organizations that are fighting against injustices all over as well as suggestions as to what people can do to get involved.',\n",

Sue something....If not, then don\\'t come crying to me; I don\\'t have time for the corporate abuse enablers....\\'The appendix that follows has lots of resources for action. I don\\'t know about you, but I\\'m starting today.',\n",

       "    \"A couple of weeks ago I was watching a session of the Joint Economic Comitee where Ben Bernanke (Chairman of the Fed. Reserve Board) was being grilled by Sen. Charles Schumer.\\xa0At this point an almost imperceptible smile creeps up on Mr. Bernanke's face and right at that moment I'm sure we are both thinking the same thing-\\xa0Because it is not really in China's interests at all to revalue its currency, it will not benefit the Chinese economy, and most importantly its not reasonable to expect the Chinise to take into consideration what benefits the american economy whilst making policy decisions. \\xa0This is a master class in Doublethink and self deception. In this case you see Schumer equating America's interests to China's and going on to argue that the chinise must therefore be asinine to not advance a policy that benefits America - it's a no brainer....or is it?\\xa0Let's not forget that China is the fastest-growing major economy in the world, and has had the fastest growing major economy for the past 30 years with an average annual GDP growth rate of over 10%. Last year, in the midst of a global recession China's GDP grew by over 11%. You could argue that from China's point of view it's doing everything right and should continue pegging it's currency to the dollar. \\xa0\\xa0To be honest -in the words of the author - 'who gives a shit?' if Americans are stealing their own elections, illegally removing African Americans of the registered voters list, removing regulations aimed at protecting consumers then charging up to 300% on electricity in states like Florida, and are unwilling to investigate the Bin Laden family's business deals with the Bush family?\\xa0But that was just the starter, as soon as Greg Palast moves his narrative on to the World Bank/IMF in South America and Africa I am seriously pissed off. \\xa0The level of deception perpetuated by these global money launderers has always been my one soft spot and Greg Palast wasted no time in exposing the truth.\\xa0I will not cheapen his book by trying to summarize the economic policies of the World Bank/IMF/WTO/IAB, it's Poverty Reduction Strategy, Country Assistance Strategy and it's Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). All in all the World Bank/IMF and it's subsidiaries condemn people to death and take over governments without firing a single bullet. This is modern day colonialism. Please open wide and swallow the economic medicine, it will definitely kill your economy. \\xa0 \\xa0Back to the comitee meeting, Sen. Schumer is a reasonably smart man, why would he assume that China would revalue it's currency during a global recovery \\xa0at the expense of its exports?Why, because the U.S, just like western Europe always assumes that there is only one correct perspective and forgets that other nations have their own national interests.\\xa0This book asks you to question the motives behind foreign policy and the absolute hypocrisy of\\xa0Globolization.\\xa0Greg Palast is really good at what he does. This is what investigative reporting looks like - follow the paper trail all the way to the end and then keep going. It's unfortunate I didn't read it when it was published in 2002. \\xa0\"],\n",

       "  'Review': ['Four and a half stars.This novel takes an issue which people usually have very definite views about and turns it into a highly readable story. The main characters are Mary Ann Tierney who is fifteen and pregnant. For reasons that become clear as the book moves forward, Mary Ann wants a partial birth abortion. Opposing her desire for this are her parents, who are outspoken advocates against abortion under any circumstances. The situation ends up as a court battle, with Mary Ann and her lawyer Sarah against Mary Ann’s parents. Into the mix add the newly appointed president Kerry Kilcannon and his candidate for Chief Justice, Caroline Masters plus senators from the opposing political party and particularly Senator Chad Palmer. Each of these three have dangerous secrets in their past. This story highlights the way politicians and their families lives are delved into, to expose their deepest secrets, regardless of the hurt to any concerned. And there is plenty of that.The characters are complex and well-drawn. They show people of principle and also those who will use whatever means at their disposal, even if it has disastrous consequences to undermine another person. And it is not only the guilty who suffer and pay the price. I found this a riveting though not a quick read. One reason it was not a quick read is it is a hefty book and the issues need to be carefully considered. Sometimes the description of events are graphic and I had to put the book down for a book. But then I also had to pick it back up again. The f word is peppered throughout and I admit to not always understanding exactly how the American political system works. Those points aside, this is a book worth reading. It is a book that will make you think. Will it change your opinion on issues? Maybe or maybe not. But it will cause you to think about them in depth. I recommend giving this book a read.',\n",
       "   \"If this work is characteristic, Patterson writes very literate mystery/thriller novels that take a public issue and dissect it from multiple viewpoints. Protect and Defend has been described by one reviewer as the most accurate portrayal of the Washington political scene. The issue is abortion, specifically fifteen year- ld Mary Anne Tierney’s struggle to abort late-term a severely hydrocephalic, brainless, and otherwise deformed and defective fetus. A normal birth has been deemed impossible and she worries that a Caesarian, as often happens, will prevent her being able to have children later. Her family are vigorously antiabortion under any circumstance Her father is a brilliant law professor and he is pitted against her in the courtroom as the legal representative of the unborn child. A subplot is the political struggle to have a new chief justice confirmed. The recently elected president, Kerry Kilcannon, introduced in a previous book of Patterson’s, , chooses to nominate Caroline Masters (Patterson’s ). There are allusions to events that take place in both of these earlier works, neither of which I have read — the stack grows ever skyward. Kilcannon and Masters are both very strong, principled characters, who, nevertheless, have skeletons in the closet that provide a most interesting backdrop for an examination of ethical dilemmas. The centerpiece is the sensational, nationally televised trial that pits Mary Anne against her family and becomes an issue in the Masters nomination. Mary Anne’s attorney is a young lawyer who wants to overturn a recently passed law that requires parental consent for abortions. Patterson excels at presenting all sides of an issue quite objectively, and it’s often difficult not to sympathize with all the parties in this difficult case. Patterson’s an attorney who knows the law, and his novel reflects considerable research. The book could almost be a primer on abortion law and how it has evolved uniquely in this country — it’s hardly an issue in most other countries. It’s also a lesson in how politics is conducted. He talked with both Clinton and Senator Dole about how they would promote or try to defeat a Supreme Court nominee, and he relates that the strategies he learned from these two politically astute people were mesmerizing.  Clearly, Patterson understands the different threads of belief that go into making the conflict so bitter in this country: the patriarchal strain in fundamentalist religion that suggests that women must play a secondary role in the home, making reproduction a male prerogative; a negative cultural response to the perceived licentiousness of the much maligned sixties; and the genuine and respectable view against abortion that relates to the devaluation of life. A difficulty has been for the pro-life movement to define death. According to Patterson, they have been unable to resolve the distinction between biological death and brain death. The Pope, ironically, has accepted brain death as a sign that life is gone, but he has been unable to accept that no brain, i.e., no cerebral cortex formation may be the same thing. For an excellent discussion of the distinction between life and being a human being, I recommend  Patterson deliberately chose to write about a partial-birth abortion because he felt the moral and ethical issues can be brought more clearly into focus. He noted in a television interview on C-Span-2 that “partial-birth” is not a medical concept. It’s a political term that has been used to redefine what abortion means. The book also deals with the relationships within families. “People project their own supposed loveliness as parents on the world at large, and their reaction is terribly personal: ‘I’m a good parent and I would want to be involved,” What they don't stop to consider is that first, if they’re in a functioning family, chances are really good their daughter isn't going to require an Act of Congress to talk to them about this. Second, we may be lovely parents, but what about incestuous families, abusive families, alcoholic families, families where the kid is used as a bone of contention between parents who are at war? All sorts of things which mean that in a given case, you’re either going to get a delay or perhaps a baby out of it, because the minor ultimately doesn’t know what to do. Or, in the worst case, death, either from illegal abortion or because of some act of family violence which is triggered by the exposure of the father’s sexual abuse of the daughter.” This is a fascinating book.\",\n",
       "   \"I read this book back in 2004. The subject is partial-birth abortion and it does a great job of bringing the point-of-view from all sides -- and no side is looked at frivilously. Because of this, I changed my view on the subject -- a very rare feat for a work of fiction to accomplish. The main characters (the ones you'll care about) are well thought out and the plot always moves forward, but by the end, it's all boiled down to the main point: Who gets to decide. I highly recommend it.\",\n",
       "   \"My mom bought me this book because she taught it had an interesting name (that was almost two years ago) so i decided to pick it up because she always asked if i had read the book jajajajaja. I love her.Anywaysssss i just realized that this book was the second book in a trilogy jajajajaja.The plot was interesting and original. I really like how everything in the USA goverment was shown (or at least I think was shown, because I obviously don't know a thing about it) how everthing works: the laws, the president, the senators, the money, the influences, you know what I mean.I don't have that much to say because the plot was about abortion and even though i support the thing i dont know much about it and i dont want to upset anyone who actually does know about it by saying something stupid. i think everyone should read this book, it makes you think in what's really wrong with several subjects. (sorry for my english, i'm not as good as i'd like but i'm trying to improve it everyday)\",\n",
       "   'I really enjoy books by Richard North Patterson - interesting discussions on issues that I think about in the context of a beach/plane read. Long enough that there is room to present some of the details about the process/issue under discussion; simplistic characters so that I can pay attention to the issues and not have too many details to keep track of and enough of a story to keep me interested. Protect and Defend discusses two issues - late term abortions and confirmation of supreme court justices and some of the things (lobbying, press, differing priorities) that make resolution of these issues even more difficult.

       "  'Review': ['I read some people in Goodreads saying that this book is composed of fragments. I would rather say it is composed of silences between them. So many things are untold in “Anil’s Ghost”, but can be perceived and felt so clearly. To me this eloquent mosaic of silences was as important, as beautiful and poetic as Ondaatje’s words in this fragmented story. And what can better transmit the fear of the people caught amidst the Sri Lanka civil war than silence?Ondaatje loosely tells us about the situation in Sri Lanka during some of the worst years of the civil war, where people felt trapped in the conflict between the government, the antigovernment insurgents and the separatist guerillas. During these years people were disappearing in big numbers, their bodies later appearing in the sea, rivers, fields or crowded hospitals. More often, they became lost forever. The three conflicting groups were the main players in this terror, none better in its methods than the other, which meant that the only way for people to survive was keeping their heads low and being silent. Not asking questions. Not looking for the answers, not wanting the truth.Anil, a forensic pathologist who left Sri Lanka, her country of origin, fifteen years ago, comes back on a seven week mission to investigate the infringements of the human rights in the country. She is determined to identify a victim whose bones were found in the area protected by the government. Will her quest for truth be successful? Could naming one victim help her name and stand for all of them? Does it really matter which group is responsible? Can the truth be more important than peace? Anil’s local partner in the investigation is Sarath, a Sri Lankan archeologist, who finds solace in his studies. Archeological artefacts serve him as an anchor, the only things that are stable in his life, never changing throughout thousands of years. Sarath seems to Anil remote and impenetrable, difficult to trust because of his contacts in the government. And then there is Gamini, Sarath’s younger brother, one of the most beautifully crafted characters I have met in my literary life. Gamini is a doctor who is not capable of sleep, except for maybe a short moment in a bed of a ward, who almost lives in the hospital, never finding peace anywhere else, who is afraid of the dead, afraid to see their faces, lest he recognizes them. A doctor, a forensic pathologist and an archeologist. A study of the living, the dead and the immortality. The book evolves slowly, taking us back and forth in time, peeling off the layers of its characters, getting us closer to their nature, revealing one startling and uncomfortable truth after another, until we are sucked in, immersed in this wearisome journey and until it spits us out burnt-out and wasted and, perhaps, a little less ignorant.',\n",
       "   'Anil is an expat Sri Lankan, expert in the forensics of old bones. She returns to Sri Lanka to examine archeological remains and discovers evidence of recent atrocities. This is a portrait of a Sri Lanka riven with murderous conflict, a fascist state in which dissent yields death. Thousand are murdered on an ongoing basis, and no evidence of wrongdoing will be allowed to reach daylight. Anil fights her own memories of life in Sri Lanka, family, relationships. There are several memorable characters, including a disgraced anthropologist reduced to blindness and an austere life that he found satisfying, another anthropologist who gets Anil involved in the atrocity evidence. It is very interesting. Recommended',\n",

       "   \"My least favourite Ondaatje book. It all felt a bit flat to me. So much so that I'm struggling to think of anything interesting to say about it. Perhaps the main problem is the central character Anil who never came alive for me. She's something of a cliché, the career woman floundering in an affair with a married man. There's not much psychology in his creation of her. I never quite found her plausible, likeable or even interesting. Odd, because we're told too much about her rather than not enough. The most memorable thing she does in the novel is stab her boyfriend in the arm when he won't let go of her hair. This happens in America and seemed a wholly gratuitous and melodramatic gesture which had no follow up. The male characters were much more successful.  Anil's Ghost has all the ingredients to be a bewitching novel. As usual Ondaatje uses his novels to learn and write about exotic professions. Here we have a forensic pathologist, an archaeologist, a surgeon, an epigraphist. The setting is war torn Sri Lanka so he's writing about his native country. And yet all its compelling components never fell into place for me. Neither was the writing as inspired as is generally the case with him.  Ondaatje is brilliant at creating all the components of a thriller and then wilfully ignoring the simple formula for thrillers. The central quest here is to identify a skeleton and establish it's a murder victim of government forces. A kind of mystical sculptor is employed to give the skull features. This part of the novel didn't work for me. One night this man stabs himself in the neck, another bit of gratuitous melodrama that echoed Anil's stabbing of her boyfriend. I was never sure what all the hard, dangerous work was likely to achieve. No one, after all, is any doubt that government forces are murdering people. The identity of the skeleton, which might have been a compelling mystery, is passed over as of little interest to Anil and her companion. They simply need to confirm that his death was recent.  The characters are all solitary individuals, some by design, some by default. I'm not quite sure why no one in the novel was capable of sustaining a relationship. Is Ondaatje saying it's this failing that leads a country to fight with itself? Ultimately, I don't think I understood this novel very well, whether that's my fault or his I'm not sure… \",\n",
       "   'It’s the civil war in Sri Lanka. Anil, the novel’s heroine, is a forensic anthropologist and part of a team investigating possible war crimes. She is paired for the investigation with a government-selected archaeologist named Sarath, an enigmatic man 16 years her senior. Together Anil and Sarath find four skeletons whom they nickname Tinker, Tailor, Soldier and Sailor, the last a source of obsessive fascination. The task is to give Sailor back his identity in order to incriminate the government of war crimes. In the process Anil will have her own identity given back to her. As you’d expect from Ondjaate this is a novel brimming with beautiful prose. Its central theme is a kind of archaeology of the soul. Anil in the course of the novel will sift through layers of the soil of her own being and of her native country’s history, raising ghosts. On one level it’s a detective story but runs much deeper than that. Though not quite as far reaching as The English Patient it shares a similar structure - a mosaic of fragmented events that are eventually artfully interlocked. '],\n",

       "  'Review': ['The Deep End of the Ocean by Jacqueline Mitchard is a 1996 Penguin publication. Three-year-old Ben goes missing when his mother travels to Chicago for a class reunion. The fallout is placed under an intense microscope as a family is torn apart by the loss of their child…It’s funny what minutiae is stored in my brain sometimes. Years ago, I was looking through the clearance table at my local paperback swap store, when I happened across this book. It triggered a memory in my mind of a colleague telling me they had stayed up late one night watching a movie called ‘The Deep End of the Ocean’ which starred Michelle Pfeiffer. They described it as ‘absorbing’. So, I decided I would see what the book was like, especially after reading the synopsis. Unfortunately, the book has been sitting on my shelf all these years, and every time I considered reading it, I changed my mind. Now, as many of you have heard me explain, recently, I’m culling through my massive TBR pile and making some tough choices.  Any book that has been on the list longer than five years is automatically on the chopping block- so I had to decide. Read it right now… or box it up and donate it to the library…So here we are… The story starts off like any other book centered around a missing child. Beth is attending her class reunion and decided to take her children along. Her three-year-old son vanishes in a crowded hotel lobby, never to be seen or heard from again. While normally this trope crops up in crime fiction this book does not even remotely fall into that category, in my opinion.This is a heavy drama that explores the aftermath of losing a child and the effect it has on a family, a marriage, and the remaining children, examining the coping mechanisms each resort to in order to get by. The damage is horrifying and profound. It’s easy to judge, to take sides, the feel sympathy and empathy, anger, and frustration- sometimes all at once. Each character is flawed, or damaged and they go through years of emotional trauma before a miraculous turn of events opens an entirely new avenue of bittersweet hope and pain. The novel was published in the mid/late nineties, and it shows in many ways. Some outdated attitudes and stereotypes must be tolerated- some of which are offensive at times. But the main thing to keep in mind is that this is not a missing persons investigation- it is a family drama-and as a result, the pacing at times moved at a snail’s pace. I read two or three chapters a night, then changed over to another book never struggling to put the book down, until somewhere around the half-way mark when I found myself becoming much more invested- until finally, one night I picked it up and literally could not tear my eyes off the pages. It took a while to get there, but once all the chips were on the table it was riveting. Now, this scenario has been explored, even before this book was written, and countless times since, but the internal turmoil the story explored is especially profound and emotional, but also frightening, and very, very sad. The characters were not always likeable- in fact, often I wanted to scream at all of them!! Still, the situation demands that judgment be withheld and so I watched from a distance as events unfolded and felt all the emotions the characters did, but from a more analytical perch. It was hard, depressing, in many ways, but also very thought provoking. The saga does continue with a follow-up book, and I was pleased to discover the author delves deeper into this family drama, though I do hope it is not quite as bleak as this wrenching story. Overall, I am glad I didn’t box this book up just yet. It will still find its way to a new home, where I hope another reader will someday find themselves entrenched in this realistic, heart-rending story, and that it will stay with them, as it will certainly stay with me. 4 stars',\n",
       "   \" Beth Cappadora, excited about her 15-year high school reunion, packs up her three kids (Vincent, 7; Ben, 3; and infant Kerry) and her niece/babysitter and drives from Madison, Wisconsin to the Chicago hotel that's hosting the festivities.While Beth is doing some business at the hotel's busy reception desk Ben disappears. Police, family, and friends search all over for days, but Ben is simply gone.Beth and her husband Pat are shattered by the loss, and their remaining two children suffer from their parents' distraction.In time Pat is more or less able to go on with his life and his job - helping run his uncle's restaurant in Madison. Beth, however, can't seem to recover at all. She sleeps most of the time and, even when she's awake, Beth isn't really there.The Cappadoras try attending a support group, which is of very limited assistance.Vincent, who was supposed to be keeping an eye on Ben when he vanished, develops serious behavior problems. These become worse as he approaches adolescence and Vincent becomes a bully, gets into fights, and repeatedly gets into trouble at school.Vincent is sent to a therapist but does all he can to avoid addressing his real issues - thinking he's pulling the wool over his therapist's eyes.After a health crisis the Cappadoras move back to Chicago, where their extended family still lives. And miracle of miracles - nine years after he vanished - Ben shows up on the Cappadora's doorstep looking for a lawn-mowing job. The reunion isn't the total blessing Beth and Pat would have hoped for however. Ben doesn't remember them at all and has a fierce attachment to his 'new family' - the woman who kidnapped him (now severely mentally ill) and her husband George. To top it off George is a complete innocent in all this; he accepted Ben as his wife's child, 'adopted' him, and dearly loves the boy. The latter part of the book is especially heart-rending as Ben's 'two families' must cope with everything that's happened. What's everyone supposed to do now? Are Vincent and Kerry going to welcome their 'new' sibling? How does Ben cope with being a stranger in his own family?How does Pat deal with 'another dad' in the picture? What's going to happen to the kidnapper?The book tells a compelling story, the writing is good, and the characters seem more or less true to life. I had great sympathy for Beth but didn't like her much. She wallows in her grief for too long and makes (almost) no attempt to 'be there' for the family she still has. The other characters, especially Pat, seem to do the best they can in very difficult circumstances.In the end I felt the book was too long and overly melodramatic.The story reminded me of an afternoon special on Lifetime TV. The story rates 3 stars for me but - to be completely fair - I think some other readers might like the book better.You can follow my reviews at \",\n",
       "   'The Deep End of the Ocean (Cappadora Family #1), Jacquelyn MitchardThe Deep End of the Ocean is a best-selling novel by Jacquelyn Mitchard, released in 1996. Wisconsin photographer and housewife Beth Cappadora leaves her youngest son, Ben, alone with his older brother for a brief moment in a crowded Chicago hotel lobby, while attending her high school reunion. The older son lets go of Ben\\'s hand and Ben vanishes without a trace. Beth goes into an extended mental breakdown and it is left to her husband and owner of a restaurant, Pat, to force his wife to robotically care for their remaining two children, 7-year-old Vincent and infant daughter Kerry.Nine years later a young boy named Sam asks Beth if she needs the lawn mowed. Beth suspects that this boy who lives with his \"father\" two blocks away is in fact her lost son, and while Sam mows the lawn, she takes photographs of him to show to her husband and teenage son, who then says that he suspected the boy\\'s true identity all along. The parents contact Detective Candy Bliss who pops in to offer wise, albeit often cryptic and conflicting, advice to Beth. It is learned that at the reunion in Chicago, the celebrity alumna Cecil Lockhart kidnapped Ben, renamed him Sam, and raised him as her own child until she was committed to a mental hospital, leaving Sam to be raised in a house only two blocks from the Cappadoras, by his adoptive father, the sensitive and intellectual George Karras. ...تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز دوازدهم ماه نوامبر سال 2009 میلادیعنوان: ان\\u200dت\\u200dه\\u200dای\\u200c ع\\u200dم\\u200dی\\u200dق\\u200c اق\\u200dی\\u200dان\\u200dوس\\u200c؛ نویسنده: ژاک\\u200dل\\u200dی\\u200dن\\u200c م\\u200dی\\u200dچ\\u200dارد\\u200f\\u202b؛ مت\\u200dرج\\u200dم: س\\u200dرور ق\\u200dاس\\u200dم\\u200dی\\u200c؛ \\u200f\\u202bش\\u200dی\\u200dراز\\u202c\\u200f\\u202b: ن\\u200dوی\\u200dد ش\\u200dی\\u200dراز\\u202c\\u200f\\u202b، 1386؛ 567 ص؛ شابک: 9789643583125؛\\u202c\\u202c موضو: داستانهای نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده 20 مکتاب «انتهای عمیق اقیانوس» داستان رابطه و سرگذشت زن و شوهری به نام «بث» و «پت» است؛ داستان مسائل و رخدادهایی است که با از بین رفتن پسرشان «بن» برای آن\\u200cها به وجود می\\u200cآید. سرآغاز داستان مربوط به ماه نوامبر سال 1995 میلادی است؛ آن صبح گرم ماه اوت که «بث» پاکت محتوی عکس\\u200cها را درکشو قرار داد، در بعد از ظهر سرد پاییزی که آن\\u200cها را بیرون آورد، و عکس\\u200cها را یکی\\u200c یکی روی میز چید، و اکنون که ده سال بین آن صبح گرم و این بعد از ظهر سرد، می\\u200cگذرد. نقطه\\u200c ی آغاز داستان شرح ماجرای همین عکس\\u200cهاست. «بث» و «بت» تمام اسباب\\u200cبازی\\u200cها و اشیای مربوط به «بن» را طی این سال\\u200cها، البته بجز عکس\\u200cها را، از خود دور کرده بودند. عکس\\u200cها برای «بث»، که خود عکاس بود، طلسم شده بودند. آن\\u200cها آخرین اثر از «بن» بودند؛ شبی شاد و راحت. فراز و نشیب\\u200cهای ذهنی «بث» و «پت»، سرگذشت زندگی آن دو و زندگی مجزای هریک از آن\\u200cها در ادامه\\u200c ی داستان بیان می\\u200cشود. ا. شربیانی',\n",

       "  'Review': ['I first read  when I was thirteen years old. It was the first of Dickens\\' works that I\\'d read of my own volition, the only other being , which we\\'d studied parts of in school. You know, I missed out on a lot when I was thirteen. By this, I mean that I didn\\'t always understand the deeper meaning lying beneath the surface of my favourite classics. I favoured fast-paced and gritty stories and didn\\'t understand the love for Austen (later cured). But there was something about  that hit me hard on all levels and there was a deeper understanding I took from it even back then.I should say first of all, this book makes me feel sad. Not a Lifetime movie emotionally overwrought pass-me-the-kleenex kind of sad. I have read it several times and have never once cried while reading it. But the book never fails to leave me with this . When I was a kid, I often wished I could jump inside the TV and warn the good guys not to do something; stop something horrible from happening. This is that kind of book for me. All the not-knowing and mistaken assumptions that float between the characters in this novel is torture.Some readers don\\'t like Dickens. He\\'s been called \"lacking in style\", as well as a bunch of other things. Well, I think he\\'s like the Stephen King of the Victorian era. He loves his drama, his characters are well-drawn but sometimes edging towards caricatures, he has a wonderful talent for painting a vivid picture of a scene in your mind but a bunch of his books are a hundred pages too long. Whatever. I love his stories. And I love his characters.In , you have the orphaned Philip \"Pip\" Pirrip who has spent his short life being poor and being bullied by his sister who is also his guardian. You have Joe Gargery, a kind man who also allows himself to be bullied by Pip\\'s sister (his wife). Then you have the infamous Miss Havisham who was abandoned at the altar and now spends her days wandering around her mansion in her old wedding dress, hating men and raising the young Estella to be just like her.At its heart, this is a book about someone who is given an opportunity to have all their dreams come true, to be better than they ever thought they could be, to be loved by someone who they never thought would look at them. We all yearn for something badly at times. Imagine having the chance to get exactly what you always wanted. Imagine becoming better and higher than you knew was possible. Imagine having all of that and then realizing that perhaps the most important thing you ever had got left behind.Pip was always my favourite Dickens protagonist because he wants so much and I sympathise with him. I can understand why he does what he does and why he wants what he wants. But the saddest thing is that ambition can make you lose sight of other important things and Pip has a lot of hard lessons to learn along the way. It\\'s a book that was extremely relevant to the times when social class was of utmost importance in Britain. Essentially, the book deconstructs what it means to be a \"gentlemen\" and makes a not-so-subtle criticism of a class-based society.Who are the real gentlemen? The top hat wearing men of London with all their fine china and ceremony? Pip, who gets a chance to become one of them? Or Joe Gargery, the rough-talking blacksmith who even years later tells Pip: \"you and me was ever friends\"? There is a powerful lesson in here and I love it. Even after all these years. |  |  |  ',\n",
       "   'My students (and some of my friends) can\\'t ever figure out why I love this novel so much. I explain how the characters are thoroughly original and yet timeless, how the symbolism is rich and tasty, and how the narrative itself is juicy and chock-full of complexity, but they just shake their heads at me in utter amazement and say, \"What\\'s wrong with you, dude?\"What\\'s wrong, indeed.I give them ten or fifteen years. Perhaps they\\'ll have to read it again in college, or maybe they\\'ll just try reading it again as an adult to see if they can try to figure out why it\\'s such a \"classic,\" but after some time has passed from their initial encounter with the novel, they will find that I am not so crazy after all and that the book is in fact one of the best examples--if not  best example--of the novel. This happens to me all the time: I will re-read something I was forced to read in middle school and high school, remembering how much I hated it then, and will find that I actually love it now, as an adult. Sure, those \"classics\" may have taught me something about literary analysis, symbolic patterns, and the like, but I couldn\\'t appreciate it for its complexity until I was older. I guess the rule of wine appreciation applies here, too: good taste only comes after much patience and experience.***Perhaps the thing I love best about this novel is the cast of characters--their names as well as their personalities. Ms. Havisham is one of my favorite characters to ever appear in all of the literature I have read. There is so much density and complexion to her character that I could literally make an entire career out of writing discourses on her characterization. She has even invaded the way I think about the world and the people I have met: I have, for instance, started referring to those instances where parents try to achieve success through their children \"the Havisham effect\" (unfortunately, you see this all too often in the world of teaching). Havisham\\'s name is another exasperatingly fantastic aspect of her character: like the majority of Dickens\\' characters, you pretty much know what you\\'re in for when you first read her name--she is full of lies, tricks, and deceits (or \"sham\"s). You don\\'t get this sort of characterization much of anywhere else in the literary scene.Another reason I love this novel so much is its plotting. Remember, Dickens was writing in a serialized format so he needed to keep his readers hooked so that they\\'d want to buy the next issue of his periodical, , in order to see what happens next. Thus, the plot of  is winding, unpredictable, and quite shocking at points. Certainly, in terms of heavy action--well, what our youngsters these days would call action, fighting and big explosions and what-not--there is none, or very little at most, but that\\'s not the thing to be looking for. Figure out the characters first, and then, once you\\'ve gotten to know and even care for them (or hate them), you will be hooked on the plot because you will want to know what happens to these people who you\\'ve invested so much feeling into. This is, of course, true of all novels, but it\\'s what I tell my students when they read  for the first time, and by gum, it\\'s helped more than a few of them get through the novel successfully.So, if you read  in middle school, high school, or college, but haven\\'t picked it up since, I urge you to do so.

GIVEN???not our finest day.it was fun to see estella yelling at havisham, though.you have to love this book for its dedication to hosting the Return of a Fan Favorite. basically the entire thing is about introducing a character, sending him away, cracking jokes for 80 pages, and bringing him on back.AND WHAT A RETURN IT IS! holy moley.my first thought, of COURSE, is how this impacts estella. and the answer: to me, rad.and on to part 3!i guess the phrase \"beggars can\\'t be choosers\" had not yet originated when this was published. in 100 bce or whatever.i am so thoroughly Team Pip Does Not Automatically Deserve Estella Just Because He Thought He Was Entitled, And Also No One Does that i keep forgetting about the no one does part and just getting mad at pip.he did make a good ass speech to her, though. that i can admit.today in  i learned that charles dickens once took a 7 hour walk through london overnight because he got in a fight with his wife, in an instance i am forced to call \"the first ever hot girl walk.\"i can\\'t help thinking i would have picked this up ages ago had i only known that dickens was a drama queen.the world is just goddamn awful today so i guess my \"escapist reading\" will be about when everyone was a weird little gutter rat in england.i\\'m going to be honest. i have almost no clue what\\'s going on here.as jpuzzle in  said, WHY DOES EVERYONE KNOW EACH OTHER.finding ms havisham super relatable. i too find the only way to respond to seeing the consequences of my own actions is by setting myself on fire.THIS BOOK IS SO CRAZY!!!took a day off right at crunch time and baby, i will not be catching up today!! pray for short chapters for me, my brethren.and so it shall be!!!also will not be catching up today. i have forgotten how to read. (it went away with my bodily autonomy and human rights! buh dum ch.)did charles dickens have a ration on how many characters he could use? everyone is pulling triple duty at this point.  i have that quote framed!anyway, our short-chapter-day luck has run out, my friends.ok. have to catch up today. running out of time.the drama of it all!!honestly rude for chapters to be long on a catch-up day. but i am strong and full of life and i will finish!!!ok...this is everything. the real love stories here are pip and joe and pip and herbert. brings a tear to mine eye. last chapter time!bye, estella!! all my love!this whole thing was suuuuch a pleasant surprise: more readable, more amusing, and more interesting than i thought. i got bogged down in the middle (and i preferred the alternate / sadder / more realistic ending, when i sought it out) but in the end, cool fun yay!',\n",
       "   'I hadn’t ever met Miss Havisham officially, although I knew of her. I have heard of her circumstances, discussed her in English Literature classes, and even referenced her in a paper. She is a tragic figure tinged with true insanity; and yet, someone in complete control of her faculties when it comes to talking about HER money. She was jilted at the altar and like a figure from mythology she is suspended in time. She wears her tattered wedding dress every day and sits among the decaying ruins of her wedding feast. We meet our hero Pip when in an act of charity born more of fear than goodwill he provides assistance to a self-liberated convict named Abel Magwitch. It was a rather imprudent thing to do similar to one of us picking up a hitchhiker in an orange jumpsuit just after passing a sign that says  Little does he know, but this act of kindness will have a long term impact on his life. Pip is being raised by his sister, an unhappy woman who expresses her misery with harsh words and vigorous smacks.  She also browbeats her burly blacksmith husband Joe into submission. Mr Pumblechook, Joe’s Uncle, is always praising the sister for doing her proper duty by Pip.  In other words she didn’t spare the rod or the child. Mr. Pumblechook is one of those annoying people who is always trying to gain credit for anyone’s good fortune. He intimates that he was the puppet master pulling the strings that allowed that good fortune to find a proper home. Later when Pip finds himself elevated to gentleman’s status Pumblechook is quick to try and garner credit for brokering the deal. Things become interesting for Pip when is asked to be a play companion of Miss Havisham’s adopted daughter Estella. The girl is being trained to be the architect of Miss Havisham’s revenge...on all men. She is the brutal combination of spoiled, beautiful, and heartless. She wants Pip to fall in love with her to provide a training ground for exactly how to keep a man in love with her and at the same time treat him with the proper amount of disdain. As Pip becomes more ensnared in Estella’s beauty Miss Havisham is spurring him on. Pip is fully aware of the dangers of falling in love with Estella, but it is almost impossible to control the heart when it begins to beat faster.  His hopes, almost completely dashed that he will ever have a legitimate opportunity to woo Estella properly are buoyed by the knowledge of a benefactor willing to finance his rise to gentleman status. No chance suddenly becomes a slim chance. Pip is not to know where these  are coming from, but he assumes it is Miss Havisham as part of her demented plans for exacting revenge by using Estella to break his heart. He is willing to be the patsy for her plans because some part of him believes he can turn the tide of Estella’s heart if he can find one beating in her chest. The book is of course filled with Dickensonian descriptions of the bleaker side of Victorian society. As I was reading the book it felt like the plot suddenly sped up from a leisurely world building pace that permeates most Dickens novels to the final laps of an Indy 500 race. I was not surprised to discover that Dickens had intended this novel to be twice as long, but due to contractual obligations with the serialization of the novel Dickens found himself in a quandary. He had a much larger story percolating in his head, but simply out of room to print it. Nothing drives a reader crazier than knowing that this larger concept was realized, but never committed to paper. Pip is a willing victim; and therefore, not a victim because he fully realized that Miss Havisham was barking mad, and that Estella had been brainwashed into being a sword of vengeance. He was willing to risk having his heart wrenched from his body and dashed into the sea for a chance that Estella would recognize that happiness could be obtained if she would only forsake her training. Pip like most young men of means spent more than his stipend allowed and as debts mount he is more and more anxious to learn of his benefactor’s intentions. It will not be what he expects and provides a nice twist to the novel. There are blackguards, adventures, near death experiences, swindlers, agitations both real and imagined, and descriptions that make the reader savor the immersion in the black soot and blacker hearts of Victorian society. Better late than never, but I now have more than a nodding acquaintance with Miss Havisham, Pip, and the supporting cast. They will continue to live in my imagination for the rest of my life.If you wish to see more of my most recent book and movie reviews, visit I also have a Facebook blogger page at:',\n",
       "   \"That is such a quote. If there was ever a novel that shows us the dangers of false perceptions then it’s . Pip is such a fool; he constantly misjudges those around him, and he constantly misjudges his own worth. This has lead him down a road of misery because the person who held the highest expectations for Pip was Pip himself. But, in spite of this, Pip does learn the error of his ways and becomes a much better person, though not before hurting those that have the most loyalty to him.   The money Pip received clouds his vison completely. He, in his innocence, longed to be a gentleman, but when he has the chance he forgets everything thing he is. In his self-imposed aggrandisement he can only deduce that his money came from a source of respectability; his limited capacity has determined that only he, a gentleman, could receive money from a worthy source. But, what he perceives as respectable is the problem. Indeed, Dickens contrasts societies’ gentleman (created through social station) with the true gentleman of the age who may, or may not, have any money. Pip has falsely perceived that to be a gentleman one must have money, and must have the social graces that comes with it. However, this is far from the truth as Pip later learns. He thinks Joe is backward and ungentlemanly, but Joe, in reality, is more of a gentle man than Pip could ever be. In this, he has forgotten his routes and his honest, if somewhat rough, upbringing. He has been tainted by money and the rise in class that came with it. I think if he never received the allowance he would have eventually been happy at the forge. He may have sulked for a year or two, but, ultimately, he would have got over himself as he does eventually do. The money gave him hope; it gave him a route in which he could seek his Estella. Without the money he would have realised she was, in fact, unobtainable regardless of his class; he would have moved on and got on with his life. But, that wouldn’t have made for a very interesting novel.Indeed, Pip wouldn’t have learnt a thing. Through the correcting of his perceptions he learns the value of loyalty and simple human kindness. This changes him and he is, essentially, a much better person for it. He learns the errors of his ways, and how shameful and condescending his behaviour has been to those that hold him most dear, namely Joe. You can feel the pain in his narration as he tells the last parts of his story; it becomes clear that Pip could never forgive himself for his folly. He wishes forgiveness from those that love him that’s why he forgives Havisham, but I don’t think he fully deserves it. He is repentant, but the damage is done.  Pip’s morale regeneration was a necessary facet for the brilliance of this work. It creates an ending that, for me, was perfect. It is not the ending that Pip thought he would get, but it is the ending this novel deserved. Pip’s morale regeneration and revelations are just not enough to offset the past. He has grown but, like Havisham, cannot turn back the clocks. The ending Joe receives signifies this; he, as one of the only true gentleman of the novel, receives his overdue happiness. Whereas Pip is destined to spend the rest of his life in a state of perpetual loneliness, he, most certainly, learnt his lesson the hard way.   Pip’s story though, ultimately, sad is not the most woe begotten of the character stories in this novel. Abel Magwitch and Miss Havisham are two incredibly miserable individuals because life has really got them down. Havisham is the caricature of the spinster; she is stuck in the past (quarter to nine to be precise) and is unable to move on; she has turned bitter and yellow; she has imposed herself to perpetual agony. Despite her harshness and venom there is a flicker of light within her soul that Pip unleashes. For me, she is the most memorable, and well written, character in this novel because her story transcends that of Pip’s. And then there is the lovable Abel Magwitch. The poor man had been used and cheated; he had been bargained away and sacrificed. He has been shown no kindness in his life and when he meets a young Pip in the marshes he is touched by the small measure of friendship the boy offers him. His response: to repay that debt, with what he believes to be kindness, in turn. These characters are incredibly memorable and harbour two tragic and redemptive stories. But, in order to display their anguish to the world and society, they both use another to exact their revenge. Havisham uses Estella to break the hearts of men, like hers was once broken; Magwitch creates his “own” gentleman as a revenge to the world of gentleman that betrayed him.  I love . It is more than just a story of love; it is a strong story about the power of loyalty and forgiveness; it is a story about falsehoods and misperceptions; it is a story of woe and deeply felt sadness: it is about how the folly of youth can alter your life for ever. It is an extraordinary novel. I've now read it three times, and I know I'm not finished with yet.\"],\n",

       "  'Review': ['Some of my happiest, and most looked-forward-to days of the year are the ones that I reserve for the re-reading of Pride and Prejudice. To quote Austen herself from Sense and Sensibility: ‘if a book is well written, I always find it too short,’ explains perfectly how I feel about this book; no wonder she called this ‘my own darling child,’ for, for me, P&P is perfect in every conceivable way. It’s the kind of book, the moment you finished reading, you are tempted to start over again immediately. However, reviewing this is another matter… I’m excited, enraptured, but at the same time agitated, knowing that it’s impossible to do justice to the author nor to the book.During my first reading of Pride and Prejudice, I had known I was hugely underqualified to review this book, though at the same time I had hoped, if I read all of her books, I might, in time, write an acceptable review for this masterpiece. Now that I’ve read them all, and also P&P for a second time, all I can say is I still don’t consider myself remotely qualified to write an objective review. But it is impossible not share one’s opinions after reading this: this book, for me, is as best as it could get. So, for the time being, I’ll have to be content with writing what I consider to be a subjective overview, which, I’m certain, does not do much justice. However, I hope that someday my sense in classical literature would become good enough to truly appreciate how remarkable this book is.Starting with the plot, which has been thoroughly analyzed, criticized, and commented upon by thousands of readers, is surprisingly, at a glance, not that original, especially if you see this as a pure romance novel. True, there are many complications resulting from multiple relationships (or marriages), but overall, there are many similarities. But what this special is Austen’s narrative: the sly humor, witty observations, unique lens through which she views the society, and the deeper understanding of morals of characters, are all perfectly concocted using her flawless writing style. And then there’s Elizabeth; aside from inheriting traits like humor and wit from Austen, she is lively, curious, confident, but without becoming ‘too perfect’ (like some of the Austen’s other protagonists). She is as delightful as it could get. Rest of the characters are also similarly entertaining, with each one infused with a myriad of qualities to keep the story interesting. I don’t think there was a single poorly written character in this book, and that’s the first time I’ve ever said that about a book. And I don’t wish a single thing had turned out differently in this story. With the exception of some of the children’s books, that’s also a first for me. Sometimes it’s hard to believe, that this has been written over 200 years ago, or this ever becoming dated. Unlike with most romance novels, you will not see the reasoning, or common sense become lost in the middle of the story, which I think will help maintain that timelessness.This second reading of the book only strengthened above opinions from my first read. If anything, everything felt even clearer, making the reading experience further satisfying. The only minor exception came with Lydia’s plotline. Compared to my opinion from the first reading, where I had been a bit angry with her, has been somewhat shifted a little towards sympathy this time. Obviously, same couldn’t be said about Wickham though. I also felt like that every single word here is essential during this second read. Although I didn’t skip a single word during the first time, I believe I enjoyed each sentence a lot more this time.Until now (that is till I finish my second read), I’ve never watched any of the TV or movie adaptations of this book. To be honest, I didn’t want to have any negative impact towards the perfect imaginary picture Austen had created. But after this second read, I decided to watch the 2005 movie, the 1995 TV series and the 1980 series, and couldn’t resist sharing some of my thought. As much as I appreciate the effort, the 2005 movie did not prove to be a worthy portrayal, at least for me. Maybe it’s the modern characters, or what had to be removed due to time restrictions, or deviations from original book, but at the end of the day, I cannot say I loved it that much. But the 1995 series was quite the surprise! It literally had almost every single dialog from the book, with a few exceptions at the end. It did add up to five and a half hours of play time, but that was totally worth it. If you loved the book, and haven’t watched the series, do watch it immediately. As for the 1980 series, though I loved it a lot, it fell a tiny bit behind the 1995 series. But both those series are commendable portrayals.As for this review, I’m going to label this as a work in progress, which I’m hoping to update after each re-read.',\n",

       "   '6.0 stars. Confession...this book gave me an  and I am feeling a bit spent and vulnerable at the moment, so please bear with me. You see, I decided I wanted to get more literated by reading the \"classicals\" in between my steady flow of science fiction, mystery and horror. The question was where to begin.After sherlocking through my Easton Press collection, I started by pulling out my Dickens and reading  which I thought was jaw-dropping AMAZO and left me feeling warm, satisfied and content. It also made me made retrospectively pleased that I named my youngest daughter .After Two City “Tale”ing, I decided to give this book a whirl as I kept seeing it on GR lists of \"goodest books ever.\" However, I must admit I was hesitant going in to this for two big reasons. One, I thought it might be a bit too romantical for me. The second, and much more distressing, reason was that  was on many of the same lists as this book. Austen fans should pull a nutty over that one.So needless to say I went into this thinking I might hate it. Well, for the 999,987th time in my life (at least according to my wife’s records)...I was wrong!!! I absolutely loved this book and had a mammoth, raging heart-on for it from the opening scene at the breakfast table when Father Witty (Mr. Bennet) is giving sly sarcasm to Mrs. Mommie Put Upon. I literaphorically could not get enough of this story. I was instantly captivated by the characters and Elizabeth Bennet, the main protagonist, immediately became one of my all time favorite characters. Mr. Darcy joined that party as soon as he showed up in the narrative as I thought he was terrific as well.Overall, the writing could not have been better. It was descriptive, lush and brilliant. The story could not have been more engaging or intelligent and the characters could not have been more magnificentastic. Elizabeth and Fitz are both smart, witty, self-confident and good. Austen could not have written them better. Oh, and I am sorry if this is a bit of a minor spoiler but I need to add that George Wickham is a cock-blocking braggadouche of startling proportions. I needed to say that and now I feel better. This one has made it onto my list of  novels and is truly one of the classics that lives up to its billing.  ...Guys, do not fear the Austen...embrace the Austen...HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!!!

       "   '\"Pride and Prejudice\" by Jane Austen started off annoying me and ended up enchanting me. Up until about page one hundred I found this book vexing, frivolous and down right tedious. I now count myself as a convert to the Austen cult. I must confess I have been known to express an antipathy for anything written or set before 1900. I just cannot get down with corsets, outdoor plumbing and buggy rides. Whenever someone dips a quill into an inkwell my eyes glaze over. This is a shortcoming I readily own up to but have no desire to correct. So I admit to not starting this book with the highest of hopes. I did really enjoy Ang Lee\\'s \"Sense and Sensibility\" however and so when my friend threw the gauntlet down I dutifully picked it up.Boy did I hate him at first. To get anywhere with this book one has to immerse oneself in the realities of life and marriage in the nineteenth century. At first all this talk of entailment and manners just left me cold. I liked the language to be sure. Austen\\'s dialogue is delightful through out but dialogue alone (no matter how delicious) does not a great novel make.A hundred pages or so in though I started to see what a shrewd eye for character this Austen woman had. Mr. Collins was the first person I marvelled at. His character springs forth fully formed as a total but somehow loveable ass. From that point on I found much to love about this book. I was so into it by the end that I was laughing at some characters, sympathizing with others and clucking my tongue at an unhappy few. In short I was completely absorbed. In conclusion I must now count myself a fan of Miss Austen\\'s novels (and not just their fim adaptations) and do so look forward to acqauinting myself with more of her work in the future. \"Emma\" anyone?'],\n",

       "  'Review': ['After re-reading \"Lolita\", I asked my local bookseller if she\\'d ever read it.She replied firmly, “No…and I’m not going to either. He’s a paedophile.”A bit taken aback, I enquired further, “Who? The author or the character?”Fortunately, she replied, “The character.”For me, this exchange showed how much “Lolita” can still sharply divide opinion, even within lovers of fiction.This wasn’t the conversation I had been hoping for.I had read “Lolita” in a couple of days, less time than my work commitments normally allow me, but I found it incredibly easy to read.Even though I was taking notes, even though I was conscious that Nabokov was playing games (even if I didn’t always know what game), even though there were unfamiliar words I should have looked up, I was constantly drawn towards the conclusion.I wanted to talk to someone about my experience straight away.My cheeks were still flushed, my nerve endings were still tingling, I had experienced the “spine thrill of delight”, I felt like I had just had sex with a book.Now, not being a smoker, all I needed was some post-coital conversation.And there was no one around to converse with.And the book wasn’t giving away any more of its secrets than it already had.Nor was it going to tell me I had been a Good Reader or that it had appreciated my attentiveness.It was back between the covers, challenging me to start again.At a superficial level, “Lolita” is a relatively straight-forward novel.Once you know that it concerns sexual relations between 37 year old Humbert Humbert and 12 year old Dolores “Lolita” Hayes, you just about know the plot.There’s a beginning, a middle and an end.A grooming, a consummation, an aftermath.Nabokov makes of his material a three act play.And he does so playfully, seductively, lyrically, charmingly, amusingly, dangerously.To this day, I cannot look at Humbert’s initials “H.H.” without pronouncing them in German, “Ha Ha”, and wondering whether the joke is on us.Beneath the skin of the novel, there is much more.There is a whole complex living organism.You can lose yourself within its arms for days, weeks, months, a lifetime.As long as your love of wordplay, your love of words and play, will permit you.Again, at a superficial level, there is an almighty conflict between morality and aesthetics happening between the pages.Whether or not Nabokov deliberately put the conflict there, he put the subject matter there.We, the readers, can supply our own conflict in the way we read his novel.Nabokov knew the subject matter would inflame us, if not our desires, then at least our morals, our sense of righteousness.Morality and aesthetics are intertwined within the fabric of the novel.They embrace each other in one long death roll, just like Humbert Humbert and Clare Quilty.We watch their interaction, open-mouthed, open-minded, but ultimately they have to be pulled apart or separated.When they are together, they are one.When they are apart, they are each other’s double.There is no doubt that sexual relations between an adult and a minor are not just immoral, but criminal as well.That is an unquestionable fact.From a legal point of view, the motive of the adult is irrelevant to the proof of the crime.The consent of the minor is irrelevant to the proof of the crime.If Humbert had been charged with an offence of sexual relations with a minor, he would have had no legal defence.Any question as to whether Lolita really seduced Humbert would have been irrelevant.In fact, the evidence might not even have been admissible, except potentially as part of the determination of the penalty.In other words, even if it was relevant to penalty, it was not relevant to guilt.Because morality is a social construct that depends on collective endorsement, he had no moral defence either.The personal views of the individual are not really that relevant to society’s determination that an act is immoral.The choice of the individual is to comply or offend.Humbert offended not just once, but untold numerous times over two years.He carefully planned his seduction, he set his trap, he caught his prey, even if someone might want to argue that this 12 year old seductress walked voluntarily into the trap.Having freed Lolita from the trap, he imprisoned her in a cage, and repeated his crime.Again, someone could argue that she had plenty of opportunities to flee the cage (which she eventually did).But Humbert surrounded Lolita with an elaborate system of self-doubt that convinced her that she would become a ward of the state if they were found out.“Lolita” is written from Humbert’s point of view.It is not just a recollection in his mind, it is a formal, written document.He sat down and wrote it in 56 days between his capture in 1952 (charged only with the crime of murdering Clare Quilty) and his death in prison before his trial could occur.For me, the written document is a fascinating choice of literary device to tell the story.The document becomes a book within a book.While Nabokov obviously wrote it, all that he purports to do is sandwich it between a Foreword and a (much later) Afterword.This device sets up an interesting relationship between Humbert and the reader.For Humbert, it is akin to a confession or a witness statement.To this extent, what he confesses to is clearly enough to convict him of the crime of murder.However, in it, he also sets out details of crimes that, for whatever reason, he was never charged with.If his lawyer had read the document while he was still alive, he would probably have excised all of the other confessions, because they would have prejudiced his client’s case (at least with respect to penalty).For the reader, the confession defines our relationship to the events that are described.We are cast in the role of a member of the Jury.This device allows heinous moral and criminal acts to be described and read and examined within a legal and therefore legitimate framework.In a sense, the book becomes a report of sorts on legal proceedings.We become legitimate observers and listeners to something that might otherwise have been prurient and offensive and illegal.Yet, we have to do our duty and participate in the legal process, because it is an important part of the justice system.Even though we have a legitimate interest in participating, I wonder whether we are still voyeuristic.Nabokov has trapped us in a game that persuades us that it is serious, but ends up being just as playful and perverse as the subject matter of the crime.In a way, Nabokov makes us complicit in a crime, if not Humbert’s crime, then perhaps our own thought crime.It is also material that, by the time Humbert’s confession is read, both Humbert and Lolita have died of natural causes.Humbert speaks from the other side of death.Nobody is alive, nobody can be hurt any more than they already have.I explored these issues, because I wanted to understand Humbert’s motivation for his confession.He is effectively pleading guilty.I don’t see any prospect for an insanity defence, even though he seemed to have been in and out of sanatoria at times of crisis.Equally, I don’t think that anything he reveals would reduce the penalty for the murder.To do so, he only needed to focus on his concern that Quilty had wronged Lolita in some way even worse than his own actions.But to confess all of these other crimes seems to be counter-productive.Similarly, I don’t think he was lying about the detail, I think that he was telling the truth, and that he was telling the truth, so that he could be understood, no more, no less.Humbert’s confession is not just the fiction of a dirty old man, it is not false or fabricated, it is not a mirage.No matter how immoral, no matter how deluded, no matter how selfish and narcissistic, it is his fact, his reality, his truth, his burden, his shame.His actions were the pursuit of a rational man, not an insane one.He was film-star handsome, educated, intellectual, talented, witty, charming, calculating, calculated, dangerous.There is no doubt that he was a talented performer, an exceptional player.However, Humbert is not an actor wearing a mask, performing some other fictional character or version of himself.I believe that we are seeing him for what he really is.He is as cunning, tricky, sly as a fox and as refined, elaborate, attractive as a peacock.His decoration, his ornamentation is part of him, his life, his loins, his sin, his soul.In pursuit of Lolita, he was prepared to lie and deceive in order to achieve his goal.I don’t believe that he was prepared to lie to us, if only because there was no point in lying.When occasionally he questions the veracity of his own account, it is solely to question the accuracy of his memory.However, he didn’t need to tell lies to achieve leniency, he didn’t need to tell the truth for some ulterior motive.By confessing to anything, he would only be found guilty of crimes he hadn’t been charged with in addition to the charge of murder he had been accused of.There was no point in confessing to anything extra, other than to tell the truth as he saw it.It wasn’t going to get him any sympathy or reduce his penalty, if anything, his disclosures would aggravate his penalty.To this extent, I don’t consider Humbert an “unreliable narrator”.I realise that some might respond that paedophiles are habitual liars and can’t help themselves.That might well be the case, but I think it is our horror at his crime, our moral judgment affecting our assessment of the whole of the person and shaping our (aesthetic) response to the book and the character.Perhaps naively, I want to find some good in him.Ultimately, whether or not Humbert’s love was morally wrong, I believe that he wanted us to understand his love and what he learned about his love by the end of his story. Technically, the sexual relations between Humbert and Lolita are not an example of “paedophilia” (which is a sexual preference for a pre-pubescent).While nothing moral or legal turns on the distinction, the sexual relations constitute “hebephilia” (which is a sexual preference for a person in the early stage of puberty).The name derives from “Hebe”, the Greek goddess of youth.Her name means youth or prime of life, and she personified both youth and immortality.She was the cup bearer who served nectar to the Olympian Gods to give them everlasting youth.For me, during the first part of the book, Humbert’s love was forbidden, but genuine.It was a transgressive love, in that it was a love of the particular aesthetic form that youth takes between the ages of ten and fifteen.The body is at its most perfect, it has not started to age, to wrinkle, to fill out, to droop, to deteriorate.After that age, the body starts to age, and he finds that physically unattractive (as in the case of his first wife and Lolita\\'s mother).OK, we all make choices about our love objects.How can we account for our choices?There’s no accounting for love.Still, at the heart of this aesthetic approach to love is a fear or disgust at aging and mortality.There is an unreality, a lack of understanding and acceptance of the cycle of life and death, a Peter Pan desire to stay forever young, forever immortal.I also think there is a self-love or narcissism inherent in this aesthetic view.I love the young, because I love the perfect form of my own youth.Since my youth, I have fallen, morally and physically.I therefore have to preserve the visage of my own youth.I wonder whether it is only possible to have this view if you have never had your own biological child.Parenthood is an education in the reality of aging.It is an illusion to believe that you can live and defeat it.But tell that to the cosmetics industry.So far I have talked of love in the abstract.In the first part of the book, I struggled to understand Humbert’s love and the above is what I came up with.I won’t say I had a sympathy for him, but I think I understood him and his love.I even understood his obsessiveness.How many of us, during the first throes of love, trap and oppress our love object, so much so that we are not able to see how oppressive we were, until after the relationship has been consummated, or morphed into something more mature or ended?However, things started to change at the end of the first part (the consummation) and into the second part (the imprisonment).Of course the love had to be consummated, but as unexceptional as the description of the event was, it highlighted the reality that the first part was a trap for Lolita to walk into.As playful and lyrical as the language might have been, it was sinister in intent.During the second part, having captured Lo, Humbert makes it clear that his love will last no more than three years, to be precise, 1 January, 1947 to 1 January, 1950, which are effectively her 12th to 15th birthdays.After this, statistically at least, Lo will morph out of her nymphet form.So Humbert\\'s love is solely for a definitive phase of her entire life, after which he expects and intends to abandon her.During this phase, Humbert’s goal is to maintain Lolita in captivity, to ensure her availability for him alone. There is no fairy tale promise of “happily ever after” or “’til death do us part” in this love action.There is no love or concern for the other, only selfishness and narcissism.I have tried to view the definition of beauty that appeals to Humbert as an aesthetic issue.I have tried to divorce it from morality, so I can understand it better.However, whether I think of it in terms of aesthetics or morality, obsession or love, the fact that it could be switched on and off at such identifiable times turned me against Humbert.He is in control of this feeling called love, at least, he knows with clinical precision when he will return to “normality” or a state of not loving.His love was a drug that he took too knowingly, he knew precisely when the feeling of the drug would wear off.So, I started to believe that there was no loss of self in his love.Instead, it was a heightened or gross act of narcissism.By extension, there was no sense in which he tried to \"satisfy\" Lo personally or sexually.There was no sense of a mutually satisfying relationship or intercourse (although to be fair, he doesn\\'t go into the sexual detail, except in terms of physical exertion).However, I got the sense that, when it came to consummating his love, it was just about sticking his dick into his love object.OK, lots of sexual relationships can be reduced to this fundamental penetrative act.Some men see femaleness as no more than a receptacle for maleness and its fluid manifestation, the cup into which they spill their seed.However, I started to feel in the second part that Humbert\\'s aim was to defile or despoil the beauty that had appealed to him in the first part (even if it was transgressive).And the three year zone of enchantment highlighted to me that Humbert would just go in search of the next beautiful nymphet to stick his dick into.So it became increasingly apparent to me that he was a serial despoiler of beauty, not a genuine lover or admirer of beauty.There is a hatred or disgust hotwired into this love.You don\\'t normally hate the flowers in your vase when it comes time to remove them and throw them in the dustbin.But you get the sense that Humbert would have been disgusted by his former love objects, his objet d\\'obsession, the moment that calendar clicked over.Obviously, this same disgust or loss of interest appears in more traditional relationships.It could lie behind the mid-life crisis when the guy runs away with the younger woman.It could explain the inability to accept the inevitability of aging, at least in our partner.It could explain we males who still picture ourselves as the immutable 20 year old who deserves a young and nubile partner (no matter how soft or old or fat or ugly we have become).So Humbert’s love can teach the rest of us something about our own love.I wrote most of my comments about the second part before I had finished reading the last part of the novel.I have to emphasise that most of what turned me against Humbert came from my reaction to his own words.Neither he nor Nabokov held back the material that would make me hate him.Still, I read on, firmly in their constrictive embrace, until chapter 29, when Humbert and the seventeen year old, married and pregnant Dolores meet again.What you think of Humbert and his love, whether or not you think he is lying, depends on your interpretation of the confessions in this chapter:This is just one part of Humbert’s journey.He realised that he still loved her outside the hebephile zone.However, he still clung to “his” Lolita, the Lolita of his deluded version of love.Obviously, Dolores is and never was “his” version of reality, she was her own person, and she declines his love a second time.Only then does he recognise that he “did not know a thing about [his] darling’s mind” or that “a North American girl-child named Dolores Haze had been deprived of her childhood by a maniac”.Then he quotes “an old poet” (presumably Nabokov himself):In other words, you can’t just indulge an aesthetic sense of beauty at the expense of a real human being, it comes attached to and constrained by morality.Morality, taboo and the law work together to protect innocence and beauty from those who would defile and despoil it.He was not above the law, he was no Nietzschian Superman.He was the fool in his own play.There are suggestions that Nabokov saw Humbert’s story as a tragedy, that Humbert only realised that he genuinely loved Dolores by conventional standards when it was too late.That might be so, but Humbert only had himself to blame.He was a victim of his own hand, and his tragedy was nothing compared with the one he made Dolores endure, so that he, too selfishly for love, could have his “Lolita”.',\n",
       "   'Now, this is going to be embarrassing to admit.As we all should know, reading and enjoying a book is largely about interpretation. People are not the same and we all view things differently; one individual might see a relationship in a book as \"passionate\" while another could see it as \"damaging\". When characters make bad decisions, some will view it as stupidity and others will view it as an accurate representation of humanity\\'s imperfections. Not only that, but time often changes the way one person sees things. A teenager does not usually have the same outlook on life and relationships that someone of thirty does, and neither of them have the same outlook as someone of seventy does.So it\\'s time that I admit, when reading this at thirteen, my younger brain actually romanticised Humbert\\'s depravity and saw the relationship between him and Lolita as some tragic love affair. It was (surprise, surprise)  that made me wonder if I\\'d had a screw loose when reading this years ago. Her interpretation was so far from what I remembered that I simply had to find time for a re-read. This summer, I did just that. I am going to point the shameful finger of blame at my age when I first read it-- I was as fooled by Humbert as the young Lolita was.Humbert is not a reliable narrator; his declaration that Lolita was responsible for seducing him is repulsive and wrong. Because, in the end, an adult has no excuse for having sex with a child, even if they\\'re walking around half-naked and offering themselves up - adults have a responsibility not to take advantage of children. And I now realise this case is no exception. This is not some tragic romantic tale about forbidden love; it is the story of how a grown man repeatedly raped a young girl. The fact that it is so easy to be taken in by him either says something about how brilliant a writer Nabokov is (which he is), or how much society still loves to blame the victim.I don\\'t know whether to feel better about my original feelings or be horrified that even the description for the  describes the novel as:  And I also know that I have no right to criticise other people who saw it in such a way, but I would ask you to read it again, to look beyond Humbert\\'s snivelling and self-pity, to see the man who considers murdering a woman so he can be free to have sex with her twelve year old daughter, the man who feels sorry for himself when a young girl doesn\\'t want to have sex with him because she\\'s still hurt from the last time. Is that love? Maybe it was for a thirteen year old looking through Humbert\\'s perverted eyes, but I\\'m glad I understand it better now.Nabokov has written a brilliant and disturbing novel; my opinion of it hasn\\'t changed in that respect. I found it surprisingly easy to read and became absorbed quickly - even all those years ago. His portrayal of Humbert\\'s perverted mind is scarily good, perhaps even too good if people can so easily be convinced to side with a paedophile - which is often regarded as the ultimate crime of all, isn\\'t it? Even cold-blooded murderers go after prisoners who\\'ve messed with kids. And, as much as I feel ashamed for being so taken in by Humbert, I know that it\\'s not just me who was fooled. Hell, even the GR description proves it. But, believe me, Lolita is a victim and no amount of saddening flashbacks to Humbert\\'s past can change that.  |  |  |  | ',\n",
       "   'I wasn\\'t even going to write a review of  after finishing it, because, honestly, how many reviews does this classic need? That is, until I started pocking around and reading what others have to say about it. Many reactions to this book are puzzling to me. In this world of  and such, there are still people who find this \"erotic,\" who in the end feel some kind of compassion toward the narrator, who think that Lolita was the one who seduced and manipulated poor Humbert? Well, I beg to differ.  is as erotic as  is . As for favorable opinions of Humbert, I guess it is possible this effect can be attributed to Nabokov\\'s mastery of deception. Clearly, Humbert still, half a century after the novel\\'s publication, manages to fool readers, and himself, into believing that he is a dedicated, caring lover, wounded and changed by an early tragic romance. Only occasionally does the truth bleed through his self-delusion - Lolita\\'s wistful glance at a child sitting on his father\\'s lap, a simple act that is forever sallied by Humbert\\'s filth, her disinterest in life, her resignation to satisfy him for pocket money and permission to participate in a school play. No, Humbert did not fool me into feeling sorry for him. On a technical level,  deserves full 5 stars - the language, the wit, the world play! - I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever read anything like this before. But emotionally this look into a pedophile\\'s psyche is so disgusting, I can\\'t quite bring myself to rate it so. Humbert is so sickly real to me, with his apologies, justifications of his behavior, cowardice, sob stories and bending of reality, how does an author create someone like this? How did Nabokov get such an intimate knowledge of someone so despicable?',\n",
       "   'An old friend used to say that \"Ulysses\" was a good book to read but not a good book to \"read\". After reading \"Lolita\" I understand what he meant.Nabokov was a man obsessed with word games and this book is crammed cover to cover with many brilliant examples. Language delighted the man and that certainly comes across. What makes this acheivement even more amazing was that English was his third or fourth language. It is mind blowing that he or anyone could write so fluidly in a \"foreign\" tongue. If this was enough to make a novel great then this would be one of my top ten.But what if, as a reader, you demand that an author make his characters compelling and the narrative involving? I would say then that this book is not for you. Humbert and Dolores Haze (Lolita) only ever (to my mind) become three dimensional at odd moments here and there. He comes off as a mincing, foppish but ultimately unbelievable sort. I never bought into him until very near the end when for a few sentences Nabokov makes his remorse credible. But it is too late for that. I was already annoyed as hell by his rococo narration. The character of Lolita as well is shrill and one note through out. Only intermittently does she come across as worthy of compassion. As for the story, once the seduction takes place it loses a lot of its forward momentum. It begins to feel repetitive and only comes alive again when Humbert reaches the very end of his self control and attempts to lash out at one he believes wronged him. All in all I think this is a book that could stand to lose about fifty pages. There is much to love about it though. It could have been truly replusive. Nabokov knew that his concept was already off putting and that the execution need not be so. Rather than serving up spewing fluids and hungry orifices he treats us to healthy doses of wit and charm. Bravo!\"Lolita\" is obviously literature with a capital \"L.\" It is a work by a man of letters who happened to be a genius - for that reason alone it deserves reading. Just don\\'t be surprised that once you\\'re done you don\\'t feel like recommending it to anyone.',\n",
       "   'Nymph. Nymphet. Nymphetiquette. Nymphology. Nymphism. I will never think of 12 year old girls the same way. There’s a stain on my brain. The power of this book is that it’s creepy and taboo, but the pedophilia and incest is so damn plausible. There’s a criminal, upsetting proclivity of the subject matter, but the whole thing is oiled with reason--SAY IT AINT SO. It’s deviant, queer, puerile, and yet ever so human, darkly human, perverted in the corner. lingers in my mind, like an accidental glance at the mid-day sun. I believe this book will have a permanent effect on me. I’m thankful, but cautious. It’s a book that I experienced, not so much as read. There are 2 components to this book that radically affected me, the writing and the subject matter.I have never read another book written quite like . The writing has depth, layer upon layer, strata against strata, texture among texture. It’s a palimpsest of clues and anagrams and reference. The author has absolute command of the English and French and Latin language. And yet, among the $4 dollar words and bourgeoisie lit crit, Nabakov plays with the language. He invents words. He hyphenates them. He nymphorizes them. It’s a gamboling and frolicking story in the rarefied air of an unrestrained, unapologetic and unadulterated polyhistoric writer. It’s subtle and raw at the same time; it’s pure. Pure, like what happens in your neighborhood behind closed doors, just before an arrest. He incorporates a dry, brittle sense of humor--even a bit of sass. He taunts the reader to follow. He dares the reader to like and enjoy Humbert Humbert. He pokes you in the eye. He scandalizes you, but with a pen that is at once brutal and sensitive, but always careful. There are echoes of Joyce and Poe.The story is a retrospective from...from...from where? What? Prison. Ostensibly. And yet, there hasn’t been a trial yet--no judgement. Nabakov tantalizes you, “ladies and gentlemen of the jury,” to pass judgement on Humbert Humbert yourself. Are you willing? Or will you just turn your head, wincing?The writing is breathless, eloquent, exacting, alluring, inventive, sexy, pleading, conceited, lurid, savory, languid, and slyly self-deprecating. The author is flagrant, unapologetic, a dandy even. He whiffles the writing in so many little stylistic flourishes. He writes sentences and paragraphs in ways that I would never have guessed to try. It’s insanely periodic writing; I grab my head akimbo in pure awe of the sentences. I peeked at an annotated version for 20 pages at a local big-box book store. Wow, there’s so many levels to this writing, of so much I was ignorant. Did you know that under the shocking story of pedophilia, Nabakov is carrying on a paper chase with clues on almost every page? Yes, there’s a whole other plane of conversation hidden below the written words--grammatically, semantically, nymphatically. They’re buried in the french words, the double entendres, the onomatopoeia, the puns, the metonymy, the symbols, the rhyming, the nymphventions. Palimpsest “ladies and gentlemen.”We all know  is supposed to be shocking, revolting even, many people not able to finish it. Titillating, serious fiction about pedophilia is the clear edge of the literary envelope, something banned in many different communities, even today. At this particular time in our democracy, as one of the freest countries in the world, and the most progressive, we champion human rights and place a huge penalty on crimes against minors. In this spirit, we are supposed to decry and detest the subject matter in this book, and lambast the author. People are arrested and put on community rosters for crimes against minors. This 300+ page book chronicles a crime against a minor. Nabakov makes this an even more difficult sexual arrangement for his readers to contemplate, because the 12 year old is an eager, compliant and willing partner to the crime.In  the protagonist is a criminal and his actions unforgivable. BUT, if there was any method to his madness, it would have to be this:Humans share a cephalization process in common with most vertebrates. We developed cerebral hemispheres several million years ago (progressing beyond our closest ancestors), and more recently than that, humans learned how to use the cerebral cortex to reason, judge, cognate, and intuit. But, hundreds of millions of years ago, way down the taxonomic branch, we shared with other vertebrates a common mesencephalon and rhombencephalon, the midbrain and hindbrain. Tucked up under our marvelous, modern cortex, the midbrain and hindbrain, called the brain stem, are comprised of the pons, cerebellum, and yes, the MEDULLA OBLONGATA! These are ancient, compact organs. They are the most ‘animal’ part of our brains. They are in control of the lower order mental functions, the basic mechanistic functions upon which everything else depends. You can lose part of your cortex and still function as a human. You cannot, however, lose any of your brain stem without losing basic animal function. The brain stem is innately integral to life.It’s from this midbrain we get reflex, instinct, coordinated movement, sex drive, fight-or-flight, and a whole range of metabolic regulation for all organs in the rest of the body. The impulses (the input, the direction, the priority) originating in these Mesozoic Era brain organs are powerful. The cerebral cortex would be remiss to block an impulse from this deep, ancient brain--even if it could stop the impulse in time. It’s difficult for our human cortex to constrain an electrical input from the animal brain stem. What comes from the stem is automatically life-sustaining, life-preserving, and high priority. The cortex usually plays catch-up to brain stem messaging.But humans do it all the time. It’s called reason, judgement, cognition, and conscience. It’s called being civilized. It’s keeping in check our vertebrate impulses.Enter Humbert Humbert. He suffers an atavistic urge to procreate with young nymphets. This is a social problem driven and turbocharged by the midbrain. He understands (his cortex understands) that the culture of the late 1940s and early 1950s find this taboo and perverse, definitely criminal. But our poor Humberto doesn’t care. He reasons with his midbrain, and pleads to us, \"the jury.\" In the not too distant past within our own Western culture, and certainly in modern cultures of tribal peoples, 12 year old girls are ready to mate. Lolita has already menstruated and had sex with a boy her age. In many cultures of the world, Lolita would be given up as a wife in exchange for dowries of cattle, land, political favor. The whole story, then, brings this American taboo to a moral question. And its a question that you--modern citizen--find uncomfortable, like I do.Even more disturbing, Nabakov makes Humby Humberty a caring, loving, protective paternal figure that wishes Lolita the best in life. There is no direct, lewd reference to the act of sex; nothing salacious; nothing pornographic. No, that would be too easy to damn Humbo to the devil. Instead, Nabakov explores the possibility that real love may exist betwain the tween.I’m not too happy to report a phenomenon that happens to men of sexual capacity, always and forever. It’s an impulse from the midbrain, and it pushes through all that civilization-ing. It’s happened to all men (I know because it’s been a topic of conversation in many different social settings to which I was eye-witness). Take for example a young woman of 16 or 17 years. From afar I see a body in bikini, I see a tight, athletic form, I see a bronzed body wearing clothes much too revealing, and immediately the midbrain excites the male sex drive. Upon closer approach, I’m horrified to see that this nubile figure is much too young for me. Am I perverted? Criminal thoughts? I don’t think so. The midbrain wants to ensure successful mating, and for hundreds of millions of years, sexual mating, to be maximally effective, and to outlast environmental exigencies, was driven down to the earliest age that could conceive offspring. So that dastardly urge men experience around cheerleaders, or girls at the beach that look as healthy and trim as fresh gazelles--it’s not right dammit, and most of us keep it in check, but there it is and it’s nagging, and I wish it away. But no, I think it will remain and haunt me at times like it haunts all men--your men--your brothers and your fathers and your lovers. I look away in disgust of myself, call myself a ‘dirty old man,’ whatever it takes to recalibrate my thoughts. It happens occasionally--that oogling--but I keep it in check. But if you think society has civilized itself away from this midbrain urge, type into google the words: “list of sexual predators in my area.” You will see a Mesozoic characteristic come alive. So that’s why at the beginning I said this story was so damn plausible and upsetting and ‘oiled with reason,’ and darkly human. Pedophilia and incest has occurred, is occurring, and will always occur.

       "  'Review': ['As I have reviewed elsewhere in The Delinquents  Lola (Kylie Minogue in the film of the book) liked Joseph Conrad and so do I, but not as much as some. I suspect that Lola was reading Conrad as boyfriend Brownie was away at sea in the early days of their relationship and perhaps she was attracted to the fact that Conrad wrote about the sea and sailing. This book of 3 short stories was all about that subject. One could imagine Lola wondering what it was about this attraction to the sea hence her reading Conrad. What I find interesting is that the author of The Delinquents, Criena Rohan, should have her books heroine reading such a dense author. I mean let’s be true to ourselves here, Conrad is no easy read. I came into this book expecting what I got, dark and dense paragraphs that had me rereading constantly. Is having to reread a good thing? Yes and no. Typical of books like this they can tend to pass over my tiny mind, the nuances as it were. Of the three tales Youth and The End of the Tether were easy to read and interesting stories in themselves without having me think I was reading classics. The Heart of Darkness on the other hand……… dense and deep. I was happy to reread passages but I wish it was not so. It can take away from the experience I suppose. Though a noted classic in truth not for me personally. I get the reputation but something just did not grab me. Again it makes the star system kind of redundant in truth. How can I not give it 5 stars considering what it makes one think about? I finished The Heart of Darkness a good few days ago and have been thinking about it. In fact I played an audio version (something I had never done before) after finishing the read so as to get another voice as it were. In The Delinquents Brownie had snorted that if Joseph Conrad was a sailor he should have known better than to go writing about the sea – and who wanted to read about the sea anyway? Brownie would not have had the patience to even get past the first few pages I suspect. I can find no reference to Heart Of Darkness in the banned books lists in Qld. I presume that Lola may have got it from the library. I am going to give my copy to a young lass who I work with who is studying English Lit with a view to getting into the publishing industry. Hopefully she enjoys it.',\n",
       "   \"Have you ever tried any meditation technique? Well, just last year I began to make some research about it. What I found was truly compelling, so I decided to try\\xa0some of the exercises I read about, which I still practice sometimes on my spare time. There's a great gamma of those techniques and regardless of your religious or spiritual beliefs, all of them have one and only purpose: to help he who puts them to practice. Personally, they helped me cope with some issues, such as anxiety and insomnia; but, truth be told, there are some things — intrinsic, I've come to think — that seem to cling to the deepest regions of my being — dark things, perhaps. I'm no expert on the subject\\xa0— in fact, I hesitated about \\xa0bringing it up — but from what I've\\xa0learned,\\xa0all these techniques basically help you with introspective issues by tracking their source. In this inner and spiritual journey\\xa0you may find virtue but you may also find what Conrad chose as the title for this tale: a.Either the title\\xa0means the core\\xa0of an unknown region or a symbolism for a corrupted human's soul and mind, it provides the reader with a general idea of what he's about to encounter. For me, it seemed at first like a simple story about colonialism written in a plain narrative. The error! The error! Conrad is truly a master of prose and he's often regarded as a venturer in the modernist wave. It may be true, if we think of such a literary movement as something related to Proust or Woolf or Joyce, who wrote their masterpieces based on a fluent stream of consciousness that emerges from a simple object or idea. Thus Conrad introduces the reader to Marlow who relates a story of his days of youth to his mates — a story which is basically the whole tale. Furthermore, just like the modernists aforementioned, Marlow's descriptions of the scenarios, his thoughts and reactions to the events that shape the plot are very insightful; the author's label, nevertheless, rests in the sombre yet alluring way in which all of this is written. The outcome: a skilful, contrasting blend of a portrayal of the exotic external and the shadowy internal. (And I've come to think the sun and the shadows play an important symbolism in this tale.)Overall, Marlow's anecdote is about him joining, out of his aunt's influences, an ivory trading company in Africa and the dark affairs that occurred to him therein. So from the moment the whole process begins with Marlow being examined by a doctor and the latter asks him \\xa0, you get involved in an increasing tension and suspense that won't decrease until the ambiguos climax of the story which is marked my the famous words\\xa0 And even afterwards, in Marlow's last meeting, there's something melancholy yet gloomy and uneasy\\xa0about it.Most of the psychological thrill in the story is aroused because of the second main character: a certain, enigmatic\\xa0Kurtz. From the moment he arrives, Marlow's told about this personage's grandeur and his\\xa0to the extent that all the hubbub about him makes Marlow form an a priori image of him so that \\xa0goes from a name, to an image, to a place (that is the station where he dwelled), to an ideal, and lastly, to the personification of the man behind all of it.Some may not be fond of Conrad's way of portraying all of this, specially when\\xa0Marlow's, and actually all white characters' ways are somewhat tinted with white supremacy. However, as the story moves forward, and specially when Kurtz finally enters the scene, the writer's viewpoints become clearer. In my opinion, Kurtz fall is a fascinating depiction of what would happen — nay, what , for this\\xa0happen to Conrad himself — what happens when Man loses what he knows as civility, clearing the way for his most concealed passions and all those feelings he casts away out of social norms. For some, this timeout of sorts, this chance to be away from their routines and get to know a new culture, it could be a chance for introspection, to focus on one's mind, like it is done while meditating. However, Kurtz reaches his blackest shade: his heart of darkness. Thus he begins to gain power amongst the natives, but as this happens his greed grows too, so he begins to abuse of his authority towards them, who now see him as some kind of deity.Lastly, when Marlow returns to civilisation, everything seems to him so dull compared with the passion, the rage and perhaps the freedom he witnessed in\\xa0Africa, which helped me understand Conrad's stand towards colonialism, civilisation, and most importantly, humanity.The copy I read also includes three more tales:\\xa0\\xa0and. They were a superb introduction\\xa0but I don't think any of them was as magnificent as , in spite of their own greatness. They have many points in common, specially\\xa0, and all of them are written flawlessly and the feeling of uneasiness and\\xa0 is well preserved, but\\xa0 was certainly the grand finale for this book, and, hands down, one of the best tales I've ever read.\",\n",
       "   'A 3.75 star novella.I\\'ve read this fairly short novel praised on its back cover in the Oxford World\\'s Classics as \"The finest of all Conrad\\'s tales,\" some three or four years ago and found it a bit tough. This novel\\'s not easy to understand since Marlow, the chief character, enmeshed by the mystery and menace along his dangerous journey up the Congo River to relieve the formidable Mr Kurtz finally made his encounter with him. However, I found it enjoyable and kept reading it till the end. I know he\\'s long been regarded as one of the great English authors but his writing style is still impeccable, unique till, I think, few native speakers can match him. One of the reasons is that he wrote numerous English classics worth reading seriously (provided that, of course, you have time, endurance and admiration) and, famously, he has written his works in English as his third language!',\n",
       "   'I think this was a little over my head, apparently Conrad spoke like a half-dozen languages so maybe I lost something in the translation because I only speak one and 1/4. I got the main themes of imperialism, racism, the thin line between civilization and barbarism, but as for any specific thing that was happening in the book while I was reading, I\\'m really at a loss for. I did like \"Apocalypse Now\" though, for what it\\'s worth.',\n",
       "   'I came across this handsome hardcover published by the Folio Society early last month at the DASA BookCafe in Bangkok and got it to read the remaining two stories excluding ‘Heart of Darkness’; the stories being ‘Youth’ and ‘The End of the Tether’ in which the first I browsed a few pages years ago and the latter I recalled its title vaguely. Indeed, this trilogy-like book should have been entitled, ‘Youth and Two Other Stories’ but, understandably, its title has appeared as such due to the second title’s highly-controversial analyses and famously-critical debate among Conrad scholars, professors and critics etc. since its first publication in 1902 by Blackwood under the title ‘Youth: A Narrative and Two Other Stories’.Moreover, before reading this book there is a point to keep in mind since in his Note Conrad has notified, “The three stories in this volume lay no claim to unity of artistic purpose. The only bond between them is that of the time in which they were written.” (p. 23) As his readers, we can’t help being grateful for his summaries, a letter extract in Jeremy Harding’s superb Introduction that we should primarily read as an essential overview:One and two are told in the first person by Marlow … One, the story of a ship on fire at sea. Two happens in the Belgian Congo: a wild story of a journalist who becomes manager of a station in the interior and makes himself worshipped by a tribe of savages. Thus described, the subject seems comic, but it isn’t. Three, written in the third person, is rather sentimental. It is about an old captain. (p. 9)Reading such a 32-page ‘Youth’ is, I think, relatively enjoyable due to his unique narration and more understanding supported by reading its synopsis at . I was especially touched by his mentions of ‘Bangkok’ in various paragraphs/lines, for instance:‘We left London in ballast – sand ballast – to load a cargo of coal in a northern port for Bangkok. Bangkok! I thrilled. I had been six years at sea, but had only seen Melbourne and Sydney, very good places, charming places in their way – but Bangkok!… (p. 31)\\t‘ … This was done, the repairs finished, cargo reshipped; a new crew came on board, and we went out – for Bangkok. At the end of a week we were back again. The crew said they weren’t going to Bangkok – a hundred and fifty days’ passage – in a something hooker that wanted pumping eight hours out of the twenty-four; and the nautical papers inserted again the little paragraph: “Judea. Barque. Tyne to Bangkok; coals; put back to Falmouth leaky and with crew refusing duty.”‘There were more delays – more tinkering. … I loved the ship more than ever, and wanted awfully to get to Bangkok. To Bangkok! Magic name, blessed name. Mesopotamia wasn’t a patch on it. Remember I was twenty, and it was my first second-mate’s billet, and the East was waiting for me.… (p. 38)One of the reasons is that, as far as I’ve known from reading somewhere, Conrad enjoyed visiting Bangkok (How often? I have no information) and usually stayed at the famous , one of the first founded hotels in Siam then, the Oriental Hotel, eventually, its administrative committee have named a Conrad room as a fond memorial honor to his stays there. I’d like to say something notably interesting on his technique in his ‘Youth’ before ‘The End of the Tether’ that deals with a command mentioned five times uttered once in a while from Marlow’s relatively lengthy narratives, that is, ‘Pass the bottle.’ (pp. 34, 36, 39, 43, 45) which, presumably, suggests apt intermissions and the narrator himself needs something strong to keep him going and staying focused on the story. As for \\'The End of the Tether\\', it\\'s a bit disappointed because its synopsis isn\\'t available on the above-mentioned Wikipedia web page; indeed, it should be of great help especially to Conrad newcomers to better understand its characters, climax, setting, and so on worth reflecting and discussing for new ideas or inspiration. It\\'s probably formidable at first sight from its length covering 14 chapters, 138+pages so it should be better if its readers are informed for well-prepared reading instead of plunging into the mystery itself and, predictably, don\\'t enjoy reading Conrad.In sum, reading these three stories would give more light on their purpose of writing from Conrad himself since its first three-in-one publication in 1902, more than a century ago, which is quite a long life-span. Undoubtedly, \"Heart of Darkness\" has since been more famous than its two counterparts and still read by Conrad admirers.

       "  'Review': ['Originally Catch-22 was Catch-18, but because Leon Uris was publishing a novel called  that same year Joseph Heller’s agent decided the title needed to be changed so as to not confuse the book buying public. Also given that 22 is a double 11 they liked the way it represented the many déjà vu moments that occur in the book. The East Coast publishing intelligentsia really embraced the book even though there were doubts if it would ever gain traction with the American public. I understand the frustration that publishers feel with the American book buying public. They have all been scorched by a book they felt should have sold by the wheelbarrow only to have it crash and burn with the majority of the first printing sold off to a remainder company. Sometimes a book needs a lightning strike in the form of Oprah or a school banning the book (thank-you Strongsville, OH), but for Heller all he needed was the 1960s. The book is set during WWII, the last good war according to everyone from Tom Brokaw to the school janitor at Phillipsburg High School. Fat novels glorifying the war, some extraordinarily good, were hitting bookstores at a fast clip from the late 1940s on. By the time Catch-22 came out in 1961 the world had changed. So those people who bought this book who thought they were in for another “weren’t we great” novel about World War Two were in for a shock. A typical reaction was:Some thought it was irreverent, but there were a growing group of people who thought it was among the best American novels they had ever read. Both reactions helped juice the novel and sales began to climb. At the tender age of 19 in 1942 Joseph Heller joined the U.S. Army Air Corp. By 1944 he found himself on the Italian Front as a B-25 Bombardier. He flew 60 missions most of which he categorized as milk runs; these were flight missions that encounter no or very little anti-aircraft artillery or enemy fighters. Heller admits that his disillusionment with the war in Korea colored the novel. It gives me the shakes to think how different the novel would be if he had published the book in 1951 instead of 1961. Little did he know how prophetic his novel would be regarding the Vietnam War. Yossarian has reached the end of his rope. He has flown the required number of combat missions several times, but each time Colonel Cathcart keeps raising the number of missions required to go home. A similar circumstance plagued Hawkeye Pierce and his fellow doctors in the Korean War based TV series M*A*S*H. The pressure of thousands of people he doesn’t even know and hundreds he does know trying to kill him is just too much for him to bear. As he becomes more and more insane(sane) he becomes more and more qualified to fly combat missions as far as the military is concerned. He comes up with various ailments to keep him in the hospital. He shows up to receive his war medal naked except for a pair of moccasins. He finally refuses to fly any more missions and begins parading around the camp walking backwards. This does start to foment rebellion among his fellow flyers and drives Colonel Cathcart to distraction. Heller surrounds Yossarian with a wonderful cast of detailed characters of which I will only be able to mention a few. Lieutenant Nately is one of Yossarian’s best friends, a trust fund baby with red, white, and blue blood running through his veins. He is a good looking kid and could have any woman he wanted, but he falls in love with an Italian prostitute who begrudgingly sleeps with him when he pays for sex with her, but would rather he just disappeared. He has this great discussion with her “107” year old pimp. Nately continues to be the straight man for the old man as they discuss the absurdity of risking one’s life for their country.Milo Minderbinder is in charge of the mess at the U.S. Army Corps base. As he learns more and more about how goods are moved around the globe he begins a business of supply and demand (war profiteering). He becomes the ultimate capitalist with no allegiance to any country. He trades with the enemy and as part of contract negotiations he also warns the Germans once of an impending attack even to the point of guiding anti-artillery against American planes and in another case bombs his own base to fulfill another contract. The absurdity of his position is that he is too important to the American high command to get in trouble for any of these acts of treason. He tries to explain one of his more successful schemes to Yossarian. Hungry Joe keeps meeting the flight standards time and time again only to have his paperwork take too long to process before the flight standards have been raised again. He packs and then he unpacks. He is a fat, pervert who convinces women to take their clothes off to be photographed by telling them that he works for Life Magazine and will put them on the cover. Unfortunately the photographs never turn out. Ironically he did work as a photographer for Life Magazine before the war. Women do play a role in this book mostly as objects of lust. Heller has these wonderful, creative descriptions of them. And then there is a nurse that brings Yossarian nearly to his knees with desire. .You will probably need to google the next one. Paradoxes abound even when Heller describes a character he will have countering characteristics like she was plain, but pretty or he was handsome, but ugly. Aren’t we all a sum of those characteristics anyway?This book is hilarious, (I laughed out loud at several points.)but wrapped with increasingly more tragic circumstances. As Yossarian’s friends die or disappear his desperation increases. His behavior becomes more and more erratic. The absurd traps him time and time again. There are a whole host of reasons why everyone should read this novel. I’m not saying that everyone will like it as much as I did, but it is IMHO one of the top five most important American novels ever written. It impacted our culture, added words to our language, and gave voice to a generation of people dissatisfied with the war aims of this country. More importantly don’t be the one person in the middle of a Catch-22 discussion who hasn’t read the book.

       "   'A  new  for my \"\" shelf. It has been awhile since I’ve so throughly  reading a novel that has, at the same time, left me as intellectually  as Joseph Heller’s classic sermon on the . What a sublime, literary feast. To prepare:1. Start with a surrealistic,  worldview basted in chaos;2. Knead in a plot reminiscent of , taking particular care that the bizarre, placidly disjointed surface fully camouflages the powerfully nuanced, and deceptively focused central message; 3. Marinate the whole thing in a dark, hilarious satire that would have made  beam like a proud papa. 4. Bake at 350, season with , and serve. Voila...a singular,  serving of inspired genius that I can not recommend more highly. This novel was so much more than I was expecting. Despite its pervasive, laugh out loud humor, Heller’s story is the most horrifyingly effective depiction of the  that I’ve ever read**. I’m not referring to the evil and vile atrocities perpetrated in war that have been so extensively catalogued throughout the annals of literature. Rather, Heller\\'s insight is geared to showing us the illogic of war, the out-of-control nihilism, and the chaotic, existential absurdity of it. It\\'s brilliant. I think any attempt at a plot summary is doomed to inadequacy, so let me just briefly frame the story. The novel follows the exploits of the fictional 256th fighter squadron, stationed on the fictional island of Pianosa, during the height of WWII. With a large cast of characters and a non-chronological narrative that switches viewpoints constantly, Heller creates a delicious cauldron of madness and bureaucratic ineptitude that is just heaven to follow. Our chief tour guide through the nuthouse is Captain John Yossarian, bomber pilot, whose main ambition in life is to . Yossarian’s life wish is so strong that he doesn’t even distinguish between the “enemy” and his superiors. As far as he\\'s concerned, the enemy  To avoid the final finality of death, Yossarian concocts a series of ingenious (and hysterical) methods for staying alive, including poisoning his own squadron and redrawing a the combat map during the “Great Big Siege of Bologna” so as to alter the bombing target. Despite his often less than moral shenanigans, Yossarian acts as the conscience of the story and helps to keep the rampant lunacy and chaos in context. His is the voice of indignity and righteous anger against the war and the cold, faceless bureaucracy that perpetrates it. Even against the God that allows it such horrors to exist in the first place. Loved it, loved it, loved it, loved it, loved it, loved it, loved it, loved it, loved it, loved it…and loved it. The writing is brilliant, the characters are unique, engaging and memorable, and the story will scar you with wonder and awe. I can’t believe I hesitated so long to read this, and I intend to sit down with this many times in the years to come. For those that have experienced this before, and for those who just want a stroll down memory lane, here are a few pearls that showcase this novel’s rather large package of absurd, satircal win. ********And a personal favorite (all leading up to the very last line): Finally, I wanted to share one last piece of awesome with you.

You really have no idea in what order events are taking place. I think he was showing how war is ridiculous by writing conversations like the one above. I'm not sure if any of his goals were to annoy the living hell out of his readers, but he annoyed me. 460 pages of absurdness is too much for me. Most of the characters were very one-dimensional. I could only distinguish between people by their names. Most of the good guys all had the same personalities and the bad guys all had the same personalities except one character ate peanut brittle and another put crab apples in his cheeks. Other than that - same personalities. Maybe his goal was only to distinguish between the good, everyday guys and the evil, power-hungry men in charge. If so, he succeeded. I just wasn't thrilled after page 150 or so. There is some funny stuff in there. The chocolate-covered cotton balls will crack me up for life. There's some really sad stuff too. It's weird because every time someone died, I cared, even though I knew nothing about them, except what they ate or who their favorite whore was. I'm not sure how Heller pulled that off. Anyway, I would recommend it. It's just that the ridiculousness of it gets to the point where it's just, well, ridiculous, and beyond my personal tolerance level. I still appreciated it though.\"],\n",

       "  'Review': [\"How the bigotry, insanity, and inhumanity of institutionalized stigmatization of and hatred against women, especially regarding pregnancy, marriage and the control about bastardization of humans, lead to disgusting world views and practices that were omnipresent just a few decades ago and still are in many parts of the world, is a key element of the novel.  Orphanages for kids that could have parents, but are born under the stigma of being illegitimate and thereby the societal death and endless disgrace and danger of ostracism for the mother, are a logical result and a part of the setting oft he bittersweet tragicomedy Irving serves the reader. Strong women, emancipation, and feminism are a key element of Irvings´ writing, possibly a side effect of growing up without a father and having an even deeper relationship with his mother, which leads to an idealization and glorification of femininity.  The role of fathers. How they react, what they think, want, feel, how different their opinions and mentality are in comparison to the mothers, how stupid social conventions influence the child-father relations, and what true manliness is. Maybe too influenced by the fact that Irving had no father, he dealt with this topic with an intensity many bad, disinterested, or overstressed fathers can´t or don´t want to invest. Autobiography and his writing are often the same and I couldn´t name a writer who added so much of himself, even very intimate and personal details, in his work. Only Irving knows how much is fictional and how much is true, but I find it amazing to use the gift of writing to make oneself immortal by taking pieces out of one's real life and make them fictional masterpieces.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: \",\n",
       "   'I shouldn\\'t be throwing semicolons around too often; and yet, after reading Irving, what do I find myself doing? semicolon, semicolon, SEMICOLON ; ; ; ; I\\'m not winking at you; those are semicolons.. now you know what I mean. Irving affects me in many ways -- the semicolons are just one example. (And yes, I know I\\'m probably not using them correctly -- you don\\'t have to point that out. You really don\\'t.) More than a week after finishing, , it\\'s still on my mind, still sneaking into my brain at different times in the day; still a part of me. Washing my face last night, talking to myself, \"Just a light touch there with the wash cloth on the cheeks there, Benny, -- just like Dr. Larch with the Ether, light touch\". And trust me, it\\'s not just that: I feel like I  the characters. And I think about them randomly, periodically, throughout the day. The novel takes place in the first half of the 20th century, in Maine. Most of this is at an orphanage hidden away in the remote town of St. Clouds; a former logging camp, now desolate, lifeless, and empty-feeling -- with its past of whores and ruffians still present in its aura. This is the perfect place for savior Dr. Larch’s orphanage, where he also performs abortions, which were illegal at the time. Larch was the only known abortion doctor in the area that didn\\'t provide them in dangerous ways - Doc Larch performed them correctly and safely, with great respect and care for the female’s dignity and health. This is also where protagonist orphan, Homer Wells, spends his childhood and teen years; where he learns to become Dr. Larch\\'s helper. He spent some interesting -- to say the least -- periods of time living with foster families as well, but finds that the St. Clouds orphanage is his real home. And then, true to Homer\\'s odd life, he ends up leaving the orphanage under unique circumstances. The story follows Homer into adulthood where he lives at “Ocean View Orchards”. During this time you get the feeling that Homer’s destiny is unfolding, but into what, you don’t know; you just know that it’s not going as planned. Homer also develops a powerful yet complex and taboo love; finds meaningful work; meets life changing people that are his new family, all while being away from his true father figure, Dr. Larch. There are a lot of interweaving storylines that result in humane, moral lessons that show through beautifully -- if not at the time, then at the end of the book, or after reflection. More than anything, this book got me thinking about abortion. I thought about it hard: more in-depthly and more seriously than I ever had before. It became something other than an abstract concept to me; I felt for the women that needed them,  I felt for the boy who believed that it was murder. It humanized the issue for me, and solidified my formerly tepid belief in a woman\\'s right to choose. It\\'s pretty clear that Irving agrees with this (a woman\\'s right to choose); a major part of the story is in fact, him making the pro choice point; but I could also see someone walking away from this with a pro life stance, or a more adamant belief in that stance. After all, young Homer was an orphan that liked his life and made positive contributions to the world, all of which wouldn\\'t have happened if his mother hadn\\'t chosen life. At the same time though, our story takes place when abortion was illegal, and you see Dr. Larch save lives, and the issue of choice itself is framed almost perfectly. The book made me realize the impact that an abortion, non-abortion, or botched abortion can have on someone\\'s life. You have no choice but to have an opinion on it after reading this book, because you get hit with the weight of its seriousness. has all the traits of a good Irving novel: the humane, odd, and likable characters with unusual life experiences; a storyline with moral undertones; profound scenes -- some zany and humorous -- others wise and touching. Don\\'t get me wrong, this book isn\\'t for everyone. It doesn’t take off right away -- someone with fast paced standards may even consider the whole first half slow. If you\\'re adamantly pro-life, you probably won\\'t find yourself enjoying this book -- abortion is too much of an ongoing issue. And abortion isn\\'t the only weighty theme here: betrayal, war, morality, laws-and-rules, the soul, incest, family, death, violence against women; the list goes on. Essentially,  is about the many rules of life: some written, others not; some meant to be broken; some need to be created. It\\'s about the concept of fate and how our decisions affect both our own lives and the lives of others -- whether they are from playing by the rules, or not. An exchange from the book sums this up quite well: “Every time you throw a snail off the dock,\\' Ray teased Homer Wells, \\'you\\'re making someone start his whole life over.\\' \\'Maybe I\\'m doing him a favor,\\' said Homer Wells, the orphan.\"This may not be John Irving\\'s best novel, but of the four I\\'ve read, it\\'s certainly his most important.',\n",
       "   'Something strange happened midway through reading , my first John Irving book.* I found myself completely immersed in its world.What’s strange is that for the first couple hundred pages, I didn’t particularly believe in this early 20th century Dickensian fable about orphans, surrogate families, an ether-addicted abortionist and the arbitrariness of some rules. But Irving’s storytelling skills eventually won me over. His prose is persuasive.Homer Wells is raised in an orphanage in the isolated town of St. Cloud’s, Maine. Although he’s been placed with families four separate times, something has always gone wrong with his adoptions, and so he continually ends up back at the orphanage, where he eventually assists Dr. Wilbur Larch in his unusual obi/gyn practice. Women come to St. Cloud’s to either give their children up for adoption or have the doctor terminate their pregnancies. When Homer is old enough to understand the latter, he decides to stop helping with those procedures. And when Wally Worthington and Candy Kendall, a glamorous young couple who’ve come to terminate their own unexpected pregnancy, tell Homer about the apple orchards back home near the ocean, he leaves with them, planning to stay just for a week or so to learn about orchards for the orphanage.The book essentially recounts Homer’s coming-of-age. Out in the big bad world, he realizes that evil and temptation exist, and that moral choices aren’t so black and white. Having grown up in an old-fashioned world, presided over by Larch and Nurses Edna (who’s secretly in love with Larch) and Angela, he’s been insulated. Choices seem so much easier in the books that he used to read to the orphans: Dickens’s  and  (for the boys), and  for the girls.In a sense, Homer sets out to realize his own great expectations, working in the orchards that Wally’s mother runs, falling in love with Candy and forging a lasting friendship with Wally. Meanwhile, Dr. Larch, who’s addicted to inhaling ether, is getting older; the board of the orphanage is looking to replace him. Will Homer eventually return?Anyone who’s only seen the film version will be surprised by a plotline about another major character, Melony, an orphan who initiates Homer into sex and feels betrayed by his departure. She’s determined to track him down, but her motivations remain vague. Revenge? Jealousy? Again: because Irving is such a smooth and skilled writer, the Melony sections are always readable and provide a bit of tension in a plot that can sometimes feel loose.A few other quibbles: Homer’s decision to leave with Candy and Wally feels odd, especially since he’s just met them. Often the book’s humour works, but just as often it feels contrived. And I felt cheated at the end when some big secrets are revealed – things we’ve anticipated for half the book – and we don’t get to see the characters’ responses. But I came to love Irving’s people. I loved seeing them interact with each other, pick up experience, get older, reflect on their earlier selves. They’ll teach you about the female reproductive system or how many bushels of apples it takes to create a vat of cider. They’ll make you consider how something as simple as a Ferris Wheel might seem mysterious and magical, or how it might feel to ride a bicycle if you’ve never ridden one before. I also liked the book’s central allegory about blindly following rules. At times the theme felt a bit didactic, but at others times it felt beautifully integrated into the story. The author has great empathy for his characters. And he knows how to create an entire fictional world. The details might not seem true in today’s busy, cynical world, but they do in the world of the book. And that’s enough for me.I’m looking forward to entering another one of Irving’s fictional worlds soon.---* I almost finished Irving’s  for a book club, but still had 60 pages to go before the group met. (I should go back and finish it.) And since , I’ve also read his breakthrough book ',\n",
       "   \"Well, after two long and somewhat tedious months, I have managed to push myself through to the other side, and I'm ecstatic to say, I have finally finished . This was a massive disappointment to say the least, and as always, I'll explain why.This book has many positive and glowing reviews, but for me on a personal level, it did absolutely nothing for my pleasure as a reader, or, my mental health. ( I wanted to desperately give this book away)The Cider House Rules could have been 200 pages less, and I still wouldn't have enjoyed it any better. The actual narrative was long-winded, tiring, and for the most part, consisted of pretty pointless descriptions that contributed nothing to the plot. The characters were skeletal in description, and I felt terribly distant from them. There was a complete lack of tension and whenever anything even remotely exciting happened, it was extremely anticlimatic. It got to the excruciating point, of me just not caring. And really, characters called Angel and Candy, do more than just make me shudder. Something else I noticed with Irving, which wasn't immediately apparent, is his rather odd obsession with women and their weight. This obviously doesn't sit well with me, and to be honest, who the hell cares how much a woman weighs? It obviously matters a great deal to Irving. There was no real structure to Irving's writing, and apart from the obvious medical terminology, his style was simple, and unsatisfying, and it appeared as though some sentences were strangely cut short at times. For a book primarily based on adoption and abortion, I honestly expected to have a winner here, but unfortunately, I'm left with a terribly bitter taste in my mouth, and a dislike for Irving.\",\n",
       "   \"I just finished reading this novel, and it is so phenominal that I'm almost speechless, and I'm sad that it is over. The story is engrossing, rich, moving, tragic, and satisfying, and the imagery is extraordinarily powerful. The plot takes place during the first half of the 1900's in rural Maine, and tells of Dr. Larch, an obstetrician, founder of an orphanage, abortionist, and ether addict, and his favorite orphan, and heroic figure, Homer Wells. Irving develops the characters superbly, such that the reader comes to know and love all of them, even those with significant flaws. The abortion issue is handled perfectly; while it becomes obvious what Irving's opinion is, he presents both sides of the issue objectively and refrains from preaching on the subject or becoming overtly political. Normally I recommend reading a book before seeing the movie adaptation, but in this case, the movie is excellent, so by reading the book first, one may not appreciate the film as much as one should. Irving is a storyteller on par with Dickens, and I'm going to add his other works to my future reading list.\"],\n",

       "  'Review': ['Long ago, in a galaxy far away, families used to gather around the TV every weekday night and watch the nightly news. This was before the mass of streaming sources we have today, before the internet, before, even, cable, before news was considered a corporate profit center. There were three national network news programs, on ABC, NBC and CBS. Each featured serious, strong newsmen reporting the biggest stories of the day, in an era before anchors were referred to as news . Walter Cronkite was prime among these. He was, arguably, the most trusted person in America, referred to, fondly, as “Uncle Walter.” One of the turning points in the widespread opposition to the Viet Nam War was when Cronkite made it clear on his national platform that the war was unwinnable and the USA should get out. One of the most moving moments in television history was when Cronkite struggled to maintain his composure when he learned, and In , Cronkite tells his life story, from roots in Kansas City and later Houston, through days as a sports announcer, from newspapers to radio to television. It is an interesting read from an American institution. He holds some rather progressive notions concerning war and peace, yet talks about how appalled he was at the clothing his daughter wore in the 1960’s. He is most entertaining when writing about his experiences as a reporter in Moscow, when telling about Mayor Daley and the 1968 convention, telling about Nixon, and the invasion of the newsroom by entertainment values. It is a pretty good and worthwhile read. But, surprisingly and sadly, given Cronkite’s importance in American culture, and his talent with words, I did not find it to be compelling read, which is what it should have been. But that’s the way it is.',\n",
       "   '',\n",
       "   \"A good autobiography on what is now an extinct breed: The great professional journalist. No longer will anyone in journalism have the reputation or credibility that Cronkite had during his prime. What replaces him these days cannot even compare. It is amazing to read how Cronkite saw the world, being a direct observer to some of the greatest events of the 20th century. Now, was Cronkite perfect...no. His commentary on Vietnam has been decried by several in the military and he made no secret of his political leaning (Democrat)...but in his reporting, most would agree, left and right, that he was a man who could be counted on to give you the straight story. It is unfortunate, given the pervasiveness of 24/7 media, that men like him don't appear to exist. Then again, reading Cronkite's work, he foresaw this...the dangers of 24/7 news outlets and how it would degrade the quality of journalism. It is a shame that it came to fruition. \",\n",
       "   \"3/5 stars.This took me just about two months to finish, however, I still found it an interesting read. Books like these, written by large cultural figures, can be either super intriguing or very boring, but I felt that Cronkite's book was in between. It dragged on during certain chapters but was very lively during others. I didn't know much about Cronkite before I read this, so I certainly learned much about him during reading, but if I hadn't had this book in my house I don't think I would have necessarily reached out to read it. I do wish that I was able to get through this quicker but alas, some books are just much slower. Glad to finally be finished.\",\n",
       "   'For the most part I felt the author to be mildly to moderately cocky, and arrogant in his narrative. This is understandable to some degree considering the fact it\\'s an autobiography and the natural inclination is to portrays yourself the hero, but at times it was almost too much to bear. While there were some moments of humility and humor, more frequently I felt it took on a \"snobbish\" tone and too much of it was a recounting of major events in which he participated in, or people he rubbed shoulders with or enjoys an intimate relationship with, elitist things he\\'s been able to do etc etc. blah blah blah; BUT, hidden throughout the text at random points are really astute insights regarding politics, society, media news, television culture and other various issues I personally think of often, and I feel are of major relevance and importance today. Because of this, I am glad that I \"soldiered on\" and finished the book, resisting my urge to put it down at times. Prior to reading this book I was familiar with the name, but knew very little about him overall. It turns out that he was a pretty cool dude, as far as this history buff is concerned; having participated in or lived through many events that interest me. It\\'s just a shame that he thought so too; lol. Had his celebration of self been minimized a little I would probably have rated the book a 5/5, but I would still recommend the book to anyone interested in journalism, or the history of his time.

       "   'Jonathan Livingston Seagull, written by Richard Bach, and illustrated by Russell Munson is a fable in novella form about a seagull who is trying to learn about life and flight, and a homily about self-perfection. It was first published in 1970. In 2014 the book was reissued as Jonathan Livingston Seagull: The Complete Edition, which added a 17-page fourth part to the story. The book tells the story of Jonathan Livingston Seagull, a seagull who is bored with daily squabbles over food. Seized by a passion for flight, he pushes himself, learning everything he can about flying, until finally his unwillingness to conform results in his expulsion. An outcast, he continues to learn, becoming increasingly pleased with his abilities as he leads a peaceful and happy life.One day, Jonathan met two gulls who took him to a \"higher plane of existence\" in which there was no heaven but a better world found through perfection of knowledge. There he meets another seagull who loves to fly. He discovers that his sheer tenacity and desire to learn make him  In this new place, Jonathan befriends the wisest gull, Chiang, who takes him beyond his previous learning, teaching him how to move instantaneously to anywhere else in the Universe. The secret, Chiang says, is to \"begin by knowing that you have already arrived.\" Not satisfied with his new life, Jonathan returns to Earth to find others like him, to bring them his learning and to spread his love for flight. His mission is successful, gathering around him others who have been outlawed for not conforming. Ultimately, the very first of his students, Fletcher Lynd Seagull, becomes a teacher in his own right, and Jonathan leaves to teach other flocks.Part One of the book finds young Jonathan Livingston frustrated with the meaningless materialism, conformity, and limitation of the seagull life. He is seized with a passion for flight of all kinds, and his soul soars as he experiments with exhilarating challenges of daring aerial feats. Eventually, his lack of conformity to the limited seagull life leads him into conflict with his flock, and they turn their backs on him, casting him out of their society and exiling him. Not deterred by this, Jonathan continues his efforts to reach higher and higher flight goals, finding he is often successful but eventually he can fly no higher. He is then met by two radiant, loving seagulls who explain to him that he has learned much, and that they are there now to teach him more.Jonathan transcends into a society where all the gulls enjoy flying. He is only capable of this after practicing hard alone for a long time and the first learning process of linking the highly experienced teacher and the diligent student is raised into almost sacred levels. They, regardless of the all immense difference, are sharing something of great importance that can bind them together:  He realizes that you have to be true to yourself: In the third part of the book are the last words of Jonathan\\'s teacher: \"Keep working on love.\" Through his teachings, Jonathan understands that the spirit cannot be really free without the ability to forgive, and that the way to progress leads—for him, at least—through becoming a teacher, not just through working hard as a student. Jonathan returns to the Breakfast Flock to share his newly discovered ideals and the recent tremendous experience, ready for the difficult fight against the current rules of that society. The ability to forgive seems to be a mandatory \"passing condition.\" Jonathan asks his first student, Fletcher Lynd Seagull, before getting into any further talks. The idea that the stronger can reach more by leaving the weaker friends behind seems totally rejected. Hence, love, deserved respect, and forgiveness all seem to be equally important to the freedom from the pressure to obey the rules just because they are commonly accepted.In 2013 Richard Bach took up a non-published fourth part of the book which he had written contemporaneously with the original. He edited and polished it and then sent the result to a publisher. Bach reported that it was a near-death experience which had occurred in relation to a nearly fatal plane crash in August 2012, that had inspired him to finish the fourth part of his novella. In February 2014, the 138-page Bach work Illusions II was published as a booklet by Kindle Direct Publishing. It also contains allusions to and insights regarding the same near-death experience. In October 2014, Jonathan Livingston Seagull: The Complete Edition, was reissued and includes part four of the story.عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «پرنده ای به نام آذرب\\u200dاد»؛ «جوناتان مرغ دریایی»، «جاناتان مرغ دریایی»؛ نویسنده: ریچارد باخ؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش ماه جولای سال 1991میلادیعنوان: جاناتان مرغ دریایی؛ نویسنده ریچارد باخ؛ مترجم لادن جهانسوز؛ ویراستار محسن مدیری؛ تصویرگر و نقاش راسل مانسون؛ تهران، بهجت، سال1371؛ در 112ص؛ شابک 9646671020؛ چاپ دوم و سوم 1378؛ چهارم 1379؛ پنجم و ششم 1380؛ هفتم 1381؛ هشتم و نهم 1382؛ چاپ یازدهم 1385؛ سیزدهم 1387؛ چهاردهم 1388؛ هجدهم 1391؛ چاپ بیستم 1393؛نخستین بار در سال 1354هجری خورشیدی، با عنوان: «پرنده ای به نام آذرب\\u200dاد»؛ با ترجمه ی سرکار خانم «سودابه پرتوی»؛ در انتشارات «امیرکبیر» و در سال 1369هجری خورشیدی با عنوان «جوناتان مرغ دریایی»، و با ترجمه ی خانم «فرشته مولوی در کتابهای جیبی»، و با ترجمه جناب «هرمز ریاحی در کتابهای جیبی»؛ و با ترجمه خانم «لادن جهانسوز در نشرهای بهجت، کاروان»، و با ترجمه خانم «آذر حاجی\\u200cنجفی در نشر هدایت الهی»، با ترجمه جناب «عباس زارعی در نشر آموت»، و با ترجمه خانم «پریسا شهرامیری در نشر کوله\\u200cپشتی»، و با ترجمه آقای «مرتضی سعیدی در نشر آزرمیدخت»؛ و...؛ و البته ترجمه کامل این اثر با عنوان «جاناتان لیوینگستون، روایت یک مرغ دریایی، با ترجمه خانم غزاله رمضانی از سوی نشر وانیا در سال1392خورشیدی» منتشر شده استهمان داستان «منطق الطیر» روانشاد «عطار نیشاپوری» است که «سی مرغ»، در پایان جستجوی خویش به «سیمرغ» میرسند، داستان اینبار دستمایه ی «ریچارد باخ» شده است؛ «سیمرغ عطار» در این کتاب شعرگونه، همان بهشت است، که «جاناتان» میپرسد: «آیا مکانی به نام بهشت وجود دارد؟» در پاسخ میشنود از «مرغ فرزانه»، که (خیر «جاناتان»، چنین مکانی وجود ندارد، بهشت یک مکان، یا یک زمان نیست، بهشت یعنی کامل شدن)؛ بخش چهارم کتاب را که در سال 2014میلادی به متن کتاب افزوده شده، هنوز نخوانده ام.؛ چکیده: «جاناتان لیوینگستون» یک مرغ دریایی است، که اندیشه های دیگرگونه، از مرغان هم\\u200cفوجِ خویش دارد، و برخلاف آنها که پرواز را وسیله\\u200c ای برای پیدا کردن غذا، و ادامه\\u200c ی زندگی می\\u200cدانند، «جاناتان» پرواز را، وسیله\\u200c ای برای هدفی بزرگتر و والاتر، و رسیدن به کمال می\\u200cداند؛ «جاناتان» می\\u200cخواهد پرواز را حرفه\\u200c ای یاد بگیرد، برای همین به تمرین دلمشغول است؛ رفتارهای گوناگون «جاناتان» حتی موجب نگرانی پدر و مادرش شده، و در پایان او از فوج خود تبعید می\\u200cشود؛ طرد شدن «جاناتان»، ماجراهایی را رقم میزند، که برای خوانشگر، کشش و هیجان ایجاد می\\u200cکند؛ «جاناتان» مرغی\\u200c است، که بارها شکست می\\u200cخورد، خسته می\\u200cشود، طرد می\\u200cشود، اما قدمی از مسیر رو به هدف خویش، به پشت سر برنمی\\u200cداردتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 19/05/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 03/05/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا.

       "   'An immeasurable love for flight, and a passion that knows, literally, no bounds. In this story we lean the story of \"Jonathan Livingston Seagull\", an odd little sea bird. Unlike most of his kind, Jonathan Livingston does not seek food or shelter; Jonathan loves flying, Jonathan lives flying. And as most novices do, he starts with what every beginner is bound to do, fail. And fail spectacularly! But practice makes the master, and Jonathan Livingston is on a life quest to reach the impossible, and something unimaginably greater than just master.An inspiring little novella about bettering yourself, following your passion, and pursuing your dreams, without limits. A truly remarkable read. Highly recommendable.-----------------------------------------------Un inmensurable amor por el vuelo, y una pasión que, literalmente, no conoce límites.En esta novela conocemos la historia de \"Juan Salvador Gaviota\", una rara y pequeña ave marina. A diferencia de otros de su especie, Juan Salvador no busca comida o refugio; Juan ama volar, Juan vive volar. Y como casi todos los novatos hacen, empieza con lo que todo princincipiante está destinado a hacer, fallar. Y fallar espectacularmente! Pero la práctica hace al maestro, y Juan Salvador está en una misión de vida para alcanzar lo imposible, y algo inimaginablemente más lejos que ser sólo maestro.Una inspiradora pequeña novella sobre mejorarse uno mismo, seguir tu pasión, y perseguir tus sueños, sin conocer límites.

       "   'You know, sometimes you should just leave fond childhood memories alone. But I have a hard time resisting any kind of challenge, at least if it relates to reading, so when Karly criticized my 3-star rating of this book (see the thread to this review for her very funny and halfhearted trolling efforts), I felt compelled to go dig out my old copy of  - and it did take some digging - to see if I could justify my rating.Unfortunately, I couldn\\'t.This flimsy and fluffy little book was a massive bestseller in 1972 and 1973. It\\'s a VERY unsubtle parable about a seagull who decides that the mundane life of squawking and fighting for food is not for him. He wants to learn how to  fly. The other seagulls are not impressed with his stunts and aerial acrobatics. But Jonathan Seagull is brave enough to defy the Flock and continue his search for perfection. It\\'s all very inspiring and affirming and I can see why a lot of people still love it. There\\'s actually a JLS website where people share their \"seagull stories\" of how they learned to overcome their doubts and fears and truly live, and they all tell each other how great they are. Fly free, beautiful white birds! And that\\'s all fine, as long as you\\'re not hurting innocent people, or neglecting those who need you, in your search to Find Yourself.But this book, as a piece of literature, has problems on so many levels: The heavy-handed symbolism. The simplistic worldview (spend all your time learning how to fly perfectly and all other problems will magically take care of themselves!).And the book tries to be all things to all people. Overcoming obstacles and achieving through your own determination and effort? Yup. Reincarnation? Got it. Christian symbolism? Covered. New Age mysticism? Don\\'t get me started.2 stars, because even if it\\'s on the simplistic and cheesy side, I still find a little inspiration and humor in the pages of this novella._________Karly tells me I\\'m way off base with my 3 stars here, which is based on my teenage reading of this book many, many moons ago. So I\\'m going to re-read this book (assuming I can find the dusty old copy that is hiding somewhere in my basement) and either agree with her or defend my position.It is on! *cracks knuckles*',\n",

       "  'Review': ['Before I get too deep into my review, let me just say this: \"Angela\\'s Ashes\" is one of the most depressing books I have ever read. That said, it is also fascinating, heartbreaking, searingly honest narration told in the face of extreme poverty and alcoholism. This absolutely entrancing memoir follows an Irish-American-Irish-American (more on this later) boy who comes of age during the Depression and the War years in a country gripped in the stranglehold of the Catholic Church, tradition, rampant poverty and unemployment, and the seemingly ubiquitous curse of the Irish: alcohol.Young Frank McCourt is born in American barely five months after his parents were wed. (Naturally, he will ask later about the math.) His father squanders the family\\'s wages at the pubs and soon the family (with new children seeming to drop on a regular basis) moves back to Ireland. Frank and his family move from slum to slum as his father drifts aimlessly from one job to the next and from one pub to the next, coming home at midnight to rouse his boys from bed, making them promise to die for Ireland. Everywhere for Frank is misery: at school, at home, in the weather, in the dreary conditions of Limerick, and in a fiercly pious populace. Forced to be a man long before most kids even have a paper route, Frank is soon working to supplement whatever his mother can get handed from the government or begging while his father is off working and drinking in England\\'s wartime industries. Frank dreams only of returning to America, where \"everyone is a movie star.\" This novel is so incredibly heartbreaking not only because it is true, but because it highlights the devastating conditions faced by millions (and which sadly continue). The work is a stinging indictment of alcoholism without being a polemic, merely a recollection of what was everday life of the narrator\\'s family, courtesy of his father\\'s drinking. McCourt\\'s supreme strength is in narrating the book through the eyes of his younger self rather than as an adult commentating or proselytizing about what he saw and did as a young man. The young Frank makes choices out of survival instincts and simply because they seemed right at the time (i.e. stealing to eat while promising himself to pay it all back later). On top of the normal perils of adolescence--sexual awakening and social awkardness--Frank, and countless young people like him, needed to grow up far too early to stave of homelessness for himself and his family in the absence of his drifter, drinking father. And ultimately, it is also the quintessential immigrant story of saving up enough to leave the Old Country behind in pursuit of a better life in America. Approach \"Angela\\'s Ashes\" with both caution and an open mind. Bring tissues and try not to condemn. Be like young Frank: Observe without damning. ',\n",
       "   \"What, did NO one find this book funny except me??? I must be really perverse.Although the account of Frank's bad eyes was almost physically painful to read, the rest of the story didn't seem too odd or sad or overdone to me. My dad's family were immigrants; his father died young of cirrhosis of the liver, leaving my grandmother to raise her six living children (of a total of 13) on a cleaning woman's pay. So? Life was hard. They weren't Irish and they lived in New York, but when you hear that your dad occasionally trapped pigeons and roasted them to eat, you develop a certain, er, resistance to tales of woe. They worked hard and did the best they could. And in between, life could be really, really funny. That's how I saw this book. After reading some of the reviews here, I'm beginning to think I read a different book. Or that I'm completely odd, which is much more likely.\",\n",

       "   'Angela\\'s Ashes: A Memoir is a 1996 memoir by the Irish-American author Frank McCourt, with various anecdotes and stories of his childhood. The narrative is told from the point of view of Frankie as a child. Born in Brooklyn, New York, on 19 August 1930, Frank (Francis) McCourt is the oldest son of Malachy McCourt and Angela Sheehan McCourt. Both of his parents emigrated from Ireland and married in a shotgun wedding over Angela\\'s pregnancy with Frankie. Angela is from Limerick, Ireland, and is fond of music, singing, and dancing. Malachy, from Northern Ireland, is an alcoholic known for his \"odd manner\" and for telling the stories about Irish heroes. Frankie is said to resemble his father, having a hang-dog face and the same \"odd manner.\"In Brooklyn, the McCourts live in modern tenement housing next to a park and share a floor, and an indoor lavatory, with other immigrant families. Frankie has four younger siblings in Brooklyn: Malachy, born in 1931; twins Oliver and Eugene, born in 1932; and an infant sister, Margaret, in 1935.The family struggles with poverty because Malachy Sr.\\'s efforts to find work are complicated by his alcoholism. The family\\'s prospects, and Angela\\'s spirits, lift whenever he finds a new job and brings home his wages, but soon he finds himself spending all of his pay in bars, despite Angela\\'s schemes to prevent him from doing so. He loses each job after a few weeks. ...عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «خاکسترهای آنجلا»؛ «خاکستر آنجلا»؛ «اجاق سرد آنجلا»؛ «اشک آنجلا»؛ نویسنده: فرانک مک کورت؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز هجدهم ماه سپتامبر سال 2001میلادیعنوان: خاکسترهای آنجلا؛ نویسنده: فرانک مک کورت؛ مترجم: پریسا محمدی نژنده؛ تهران، درفام، 1377؛ موضوع: سرگذشتنامه امریکاییهای ایرلندی تبار - آداب و رسوم مردمان ایرلند - سده 20معنوان: اجاق سرد آنجلا؛ نویسنده: فرانک مک کورت؛ مترجم: گلی امامی؛ تهران، فرزان روز، 1379؛ در 600ص؛ شابک 9643210529؛ چاپ سوم 1385؛ شابک 9789643210526؛ چاپ پنجم 13933؛ عنوان: اشک آنجلا؛ نویسنده: فرانک مک کورت؛ مترجم: زهرا تابشیان؛ تهران، نشر دشتستان، 1378؛ در 518ص؛ شابک 9649174877؛ عنوان: خاکستر آنجلا؛ نویسنده: فرانک مک کورت؛ مترجم: نینا پزشکیان؛ تهران، بدرقه جاویدان، 1380؛ در 618ص؛ شابک 9649345469؛ عنوان: خاکسترهای آنجلا؛ نویسنده: فرانک مک کورت؛ مترجم: منیژه شیخ جوادی (بهزاد)؛ تهران، پیکان، 1384؛ در 470 ص؛خود نگاشت زندگینامه ای اثر «فرانک مک کورت» است؛ «خاکسترهای آنجلا»، یا «اجاق سرد آنجلا»، اتوبیوگرافی نویسنده ی ایرلندی تبار آمریکایی، که در سال 1996میلادی برای نخستین بار منتشر شده\\u200c است؛ رمان زندگی «فرانک مک\\u200c کورت» در «کودکی»، و «نوجوانی»؛ در «بروکلین نیویورک»، و «لیمریک (شهری در ایرلند)» است؛ داستان، شرح زندگی فقیرانه ی «فرانک»، پدر دائم\\u200c الخمرش «مالکی»، که پولی برای خانواده باقی نمی\\u200cگذاشته، و نیز بازگویی تلاش\\u200cهای مادرش «آنجلا»، برای نجات خانواده است؛ خاکسترهای «آنجلا»، برنده ی جایزه ی «پولیتزر»، در رشته ی زندگی\\u200cنامه در سال 1997میلادی شده؛ «فرانک مک\\u200cکورت»، کتابک «تیز» را در سال 1999میلادی، و «آقا معلم» را در سال 2005میلادی، به عنوان دنباله ی «خاکسترهای آنجلا» به چاپ رسانده اند؛تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 11/07/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 09/06/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی',\n",
       "   'I think I read Angela’s Ashes by Frank McCourt initially when the book was first published. In high school at the time, my mother and I shared books. I was introduced to all of her favorite authors that way and most of these authors I still read now. One author who was new to both of us at the time was New York school teacher Frank McCourt who published a memoir of his life growing up in Brooklyn and Limerick, Ireland. As with most books from that era, I had vague recollections because I spent the next twenty years finishing high school and college and raising a family. Books I read in high school were not at the forefront of my mind. Since my youngest daughter transitioned to a full school day three years ago, I have gone back and read all of those forgotten to me books from high school through adult eyes. The experience has been for the most part positive with only a few books that stand out as disliking. With my ongoing lifetime Pulitzer challenge focusing on nonfiction winners this year, I decided to finally turn my attention back to Angela’s Ashes and found it a worthy book indeed. Angela Sheehan immigrated to America from Limerick, Ireland at the onset of the Depression. Life in the slums of Limerick was unbearable even for a champion ballroom dancer like Angela. Immediately after stepping off the boat, Angela meets Malachy McCourt and becomes pregnant by him. Being good Catholics, the couple gets married. Five months later, Frank is born, followed in close succession by Malachy, twins Oliver and Eugène, and Margaret. Malachy (the father) is a chronic drunk and spends all of his wages on drinks in local pubs. The children have no food, Margaret dies from SIDS, the twins wear rags for diapers, and Angela is inconsolable. At the urging of cousins, the family emigrates back to Limerick because as destitute as life is there, the McCourts will be among family who can support them in their desperate hour. Ireland and its green land of the River Shannon and Cuchulain the hero who died for the country do not solve Malachy’s drinking problem. He can barely hold a job and Angela and the children still have barely any food to eat. The children still wear rags for diapers and the family shares two beds in flea and lice infested apartments where an entire building shares one bathroom. The twins succumb to illness and all is too much for Angela to handle. Her mother and sister have no sympathy for her situation and the family is relegated to going on the dole and asking for handouts at St Vincent of the Destitute. The McCourts eventually move to a home at the top of Roden Lane. It is as decrepit as their other homes but at least no one died there despite having one lavatory for the entire street that is right outside of their home. Although a chronic drunk, Malachy makes the best of the situation naming the downstairs portion of their home Ireland and the upstairs Italy. The children rarely have food but at least they have each other and stories told of old Ireland by the fireplace each morning. Frank and Malachy and eventually surviving brothers Michael and Alphonsus attend the Leamy National School for the poor. Run by priests, it is a quality education despite the fact that most of the boys rarely eat, wear dilapidated shoes, and have parents who survive on the dole or handouts. The River Shannon and its environs sickens the air and Frank can name many friends and acquaintances who have died over the years of consumption. Yet, despite the horrendous upbringing that Frank McCourt knew, Angela’s Ashes had me laughing over the course of the book as he used humor to get through the darkest of situations of his life. His uncle Pa Keating was quite the character and interactions with him had me in stitches. Frank’s fear of confession to the priests and then his time in confession was also laced with comedy, as were most every other episode in the memoir, including dance lessons and mooching off school to run in an apple orchard with friends. If the situation was not so dire, perhaps comedy would not have been needed, yet Frank McCourt had a gift with words even as a kid. It was this gift that had his mother and other relatives telling him that he would go far in life in spite of the environs of Limerick during the darkest days of both the Depression and World War II. With a drunk father and destitute mother, Frank desired to go to America as soon as he had the means to do so. By age nineteen, he sailed on a reverse trip back to New York and Frank was in America to stay. Eventually Malachy would follow and they would develop a comedic act for two about growing up poor in Ireland. Angela’s Ashes, despite the impoverished environment that it describes, is one of the most inspiring books I have read. How could anyone have an attitude other than positive and expect to rise from the slums of Limerick and make something of one’s life. Frank McCourt could find humor in any situation, even one that saw his parents bury three children and live for nearly twenty years on public assistance. Angela’s Ashes brings to light this horrendous situation and has me realize that even though the United States was also hit by depression, it is still the land of opportunity for people around the globe, the McCourts included. Thankfully, Frank McCourt reached New York and eventually told his story to the world, offering a beacon of light in even the darkest of times. 5 stars'],\n",

Frank's mother, Angela, has no money to feed the children since Frank's father, Malachy, rarely works, and when he does he drinks his wages. Yet Malachy—exasperating, irresponsible and beguiling—does nurture in Frank an appetite for the one thing he can provide: a story.

       "  'Review': [\"After about page 200 I realised this was like eating Turkish Delight morning noon and night and my spiritual teeth were beginning to dissolve under a tide of sickliness which didn't ever let up. All these characters are so unbearably cute, even the less-nice ones. If post-independent India was crossed with Bambi, it would be Vikram Seth's endless gurgling prose. So I stopped reading and drove several three inch nails into my head, and I've been all right since then.\",\n",
       "   \"A Suitable Boy is a behemoth book of approximately 1,500 pages by Vikram Seth which is allegedly about a young woman named Lata who is trying to find a suitable boy to marry. The book centers on four different families as well as various political and social movements in India in the 1950’s. Never have I encountered a book that was more in need of an editor. There were far, far, far too many characters. The book starts off by displaying family trees, four family trees. However, that would not even cover all of the characters by a long shot. There were friends, politicians, teachers, sisters, musicians, and many more. The author really should have focused on a smaller set of characters and written several books rather than this mess. Additionally, this book was boring. It was like watching paint dry. If you want to read a great book set in India, I would highly recommend A Fine Balance. With so many characters in A Suitable Boy, it was difficult to connect with anyone. After the first one hundred pages, I thought that the pacing would pick up, but it didn’t. As if following 4 families wasn’t enough, this book was also some type of historical fiction. However, it didn’t work for me. The author would talk in excruciating detail about certain religious and political moments, but the reader wasn’t given enough information to put the moments into context. It would have been helpful to summarize the historical context or even hint at some of the context so that the reader could look it up. But I felt like I was thrown into the deep end of the swimming pool, drowning. After nearly 1,500 pages, the ending felt rather rushed and non-eventful. Lata makes her choice suddenly and with very little fanfare. This was rather disappointing after slogging through so much. The other disappointment with this book is that I could not find an audiobook for this book that was not unabridged, and the prose was not very smooth. The most interesting part about this book was Cuddles the dog who went around and bit everyone.Well, another one to cross off the 100 Books To Read Before You Die According the BBC….(30/100)2022 Reading ScheduleJan Animal FarmFeb Lord of the FliesMar The Da Vinci CodeApr Of Mice and MenMay Memoirs of a GeishaJun Little WomenJul The Lovely BonesAug Charlotte's WebSep Life of PiOct DraculaNov Gone with the WindDec The Secret GardenConnect With Me!   \",\n",
       "   'This is a magnificent saga, which left me breathless and awaiting the next word, set in India at the beginning of the fifties.\"Suitable Boy\" by Vikram Seth\\'s “epic love story set in India. Funny and tragic, with engaging, brilliantly observed characters, it is as close as you can get to Dickens for the twentieth century. The story unfolds through four middle class families - the Mehras, Kappoors, Khans and Chatterjis. Lata Mehra, a university student, is under pressure from her mother to get married. But not to just anyone she happens to fall in love with. There are standards to be met and finding a husband for Lata becomes a family affair in which all the members are to play a part.”“The richness of this book is remarkable. What with marriage, religion, customs, etc. it has been a really fascinating read for me.”India\\'s caste system has four main classes (also called varnas) based originally on personality, profession and birth. I’m eternally grateful to Fionnuala for suggesting that I may perhaps like this author. Do I like Vikram Seth? No, of course not. I just happen to adore him. I think that he’s absolutely splendid. I get the same pleasure reading this book as when I’m eating lobster or tasting a superb Burgundy wine or whatever sublime other pleasures that we have in life…My…I must confess that I had never heard of Seth before and I wouldn’t if it hadn’t been for Goodreads. It’s one of those remarkable books that becomes a reference book that once read, you can open it at any page and still get that continual enjoyment. It’s a wonderful sensation to savour…It’s always so difficult for me to write a review on a book that I “love to death” but that has been the case here. This is now my second favourite fiction book after “The Alexandria Quartet” and I could never do that justice. Bravo for the past for Durrell and for the present for Vikram Seth.In conclusion, Fionnuala and Seth – thank you for giving me so much pleasure. What a serendipitous find. I love this book.',\n",
       "   'I know some GR’ers didn’t really cotton on to the style of this book. And maybe it was because I read this while on vacation in India itself, but wow! Just W.O.W! It’s a fucking long book—1,500 pages. And every single page was worth the time I spent on it and more. If  is India’s , then  must be its . It’s got the same melding of personal lives seen in amidst great national events. Instead of the romance of Natasha and Pierre, it’s that of Lata and her three suitors. Instead of the war with France, we have the post-Independence and post-Partition politics of a nation searching for an identity. And instead of descriptions of war, we get exchanges of heated debate on the floor of the state parliament, and the passing of a contentious bill. Seth looks at the lives of four families intertwined by marriage and friendship. And all the detail—and it is indeed loving detail—is very very necessary to immerse you in the India of the 1950s, and what it felt like to be alive then. We get details of village life, life in the city, life of the different castes, business life, religious life, modern life, traditional life. It’s all there. And it works in tandem with several great stories of love and passion, and what these mean, both at the level of family, romance, and nation. Word has it that Seth is working on a follow up (not sure if it’s a sequel as such) to be called “A Suitable Girl”. I, for one, can’t wait. ',\n",
       "   '*Spoiler alert*I finally finished reading A Suitable Boy by Vikram Seth. For some reason, I used to avoid picking it up and kept putting it off. I suppose it was mainly the size (it’s one thick book - approximately 1500 pages!) but I also think it had to do with this misconception I had that it would be a tough read, that Seth’s writing would be pompous and saturated with flowery descriptions of rivers winding through the green and yellow village of GraamNagar. Imagine my surprise when I find that the language is smooth, his tone light and his narrative interesting. The fact that Seth managed to keep the threads of the numerous plots and subplots clear in his head is an accomplishment in itself, but even more impressive is how each characters of his story is real; they are people we recognize, with mannerisms we’ve noticed in ourselves and others, and dialogues we’ve heard, thought or spoken. The title might suggest that it’s the story of finding the perfect marriage candidate for the central character but that would be belittling the grand work that is A Suitable Boy. It is the story of the Mehras, the Kapoors, the Khans, the Chatterjis and a myriad of other characters, such as Saeeda Bai and Kakoli, many of whom are fleshed out substantially, even when their appearance is minimal. The beauty of the story arises from their interactions with each other, their thoughts and their ups and downs. Little details that create vivid images of a decaying courtesan’s world, a cosmopolitan Calcutta, the shoemakers’ rank (as in rancid) neighbourhoods and so on. The story covers about a year of the characters’ lives, detailing the day to day mundanity. Little decisions — a smile here, a letter there, a glass of nimbu pani (lemon-water) every now and then - are what makes the story. Yet these little decisions, these microsteps that are taken, culminate in huge changes that are noticed only in hindsight.I’m probably not giving away any surprises when I say that I was thoroughly pissed off at Lata Mehra’s decision to marry Haresh Khanna. I shouldn’t have been surprised because Lata does say in the first few pages, ” I always obey my mother” and so the ending wasn’t so much a surprise as it was a disappointment. I did understand why she did it, but I couldn’t help my acute disappointment in her all the same. I was genuinely frustrated at her pigheadedness, her thought process that led her to this decision. I was angry because I am afraid that her reasoning resonated with the coward in everyone, especially south asian girls who have had to, or will have to, at least discuss the concept of arranged marriage at some point in their lives.Ironically, her mother later suffered a number of qualms herself about whether Haresh would be the right boy for her daughter. Had Lata decided against the marriage, Mrs. Mehra would have been perfectly amenable, especially since Lata’s yuppie brother Arun did not condone the marriage either. So why did Lata decide to snub both Kabir, the Muslim she fell in love with, or Amit, the Bengali poet she could fall in love with easily? Her reasoning in the last few pages was scary because it reminded me of how we would rather our lives be a smooth ride of mediocrity than a roller coaster of brilliance that plummets from time to time. We choose to be mediocre-ly happy - the utilitarian idea that the “aim of action should be the largest possible balance of pleasure over pain or the greatest happiness of the greatest number” (). She says, “I’m not myself when I’m with him [Kabir]. I ask myself, who is this - this jealous, obsessed woman….I don’t want to [passionately love him], I don’t know want to. If that’s what passion means, I dont’ want it.”Once Lata makes her decision, we know that she will lead her life contently enough. It upset me because I saw Lata in a number of people I know in real life, including myself. Mind you, I am not advocating against arranged marriage as a whole because I know they can work. Lata’s sister Savita, who marries Pran after meeting him only once in front of her elders, does genuinely fall in love with him and go on to lead a happy life. So it’s not that arranged marriages are wrong. I just felt that Lata was wrong in her decision to marry Haresh. Even if he was considered fair and good looking, confident and ambitious. Ironically, from Haresh’s side, it’s not exactly a traditional arranged marriage. He arranges his nuptials himself because he doesn’t like the parents getting involved in this matter; his parents already know that he will run away (metaphorically speaking) if they try to set him up. So to Haresh, this is a decision he’s making by himself for his own benefit. Haresh had already been in love with someone else before, had neatly folded away his Devdas romanticism for that girl and was ready now to live a contented life with someone else (it just happened to be Lata). He is oh so bloody honest about his feelings for this girl, and that he knows it won’t ever happen and so must move on… Lata wanted his practicality, his forceful ability to get things done, his willingness to help out her family members. What angered me was the underlying assumption that Kabir/Amit couldn’t be all those things, that they would be selfish beings simply because they would also love her, and she would have to him (either him) back. My favourite characters in the book are Amit Chatterji and Pran Kapoor. I know Vikram Seth denies fashioning Amit after him, but to be honest, for some reason while I was reading about Amit’s tendencies for the necessary inactivity that comes with being a writer, I thought of Seth. What I liked about Amit was that he was the uber intellectual: his tone was oft-sardonic, his amusement frequent, his observations of people accepting and piercing. He talked a lot and said very little. He was cryptic in his cynicism. I loved him. Lata rejects him on the basis of his being \"high-maintenance\" type - someone who needs his meals laid out for him, who wouldn’t have time for her if he was working on a novel, and whose moodswings are as frequent as her own. I don’t buy that completely. He did make the time for her, he knew how to be charming and behave in society (he wasn’t an absent-minded intellectual), he knew what he wanted and he knew how to get what he wants. Lata was right in that he wouldn’t fall apart at her rejection, but I think it’s not his insensitivity that would allow him to be friends with her after her marriage, but his excessive civility, his sophistication and his writer’s acceptance of life.My other favourite character, Pran Kapoor - a thin, dark quiet professor - is a sweetheart. The kind of nice guy who doesn’t begrudge his mother-in-law’s long vacations with them, who plays April Fools Day jokes on people because “those who aren’t conscious of the date must take the consequences”. He is the ultimate good son, who quietly accepts his arranged marriage and falls in love with his wife. His was the real arranged marriage, in the true sense of the word, and yet you cannot dislike him or his wife Savita because they are both so lovable people, that you just know that they were destined to be together, no matter how they got together.For those of you who haven’t read it, do. Trust me, I can’t begin to describe the many shades there are to each character and how nothing I say will completely do justice to them. I got mad at one character’s one decision, not at the book. Seth is amazing. His voice is uninstrusive and style very graceful. That’s the word: graceful. Despite its size, you get a soft feeling reading it. True it is a tad tedious at times. Some of the political parts and some of the characters could have been done without. But in the end, you can’t get angry at someone who gives you the whole cake when all you asked for was a slice.'],\n",

In both attempts to read this I have yet to get to anything to do with the Gospel of Judas in the manner the book cover suggests, unless it is some oblique symbol of all the betrayals going on in this priest's life. And I haven't the time nor inclination to plough through this to get to it so that the light dawns on me and I understand what all this initial tedium was about. If I want to read about priests having affairs with social twits then I'd go for some bodice rippers who make no pretense about it. As for the GoJ, there were no redeeming aspects to any of the characters, which rendered absolutely no interest in their lives and therefore the book.

The Mexican police take him off and shoot him while the two friends wait, helpless to stop it. A good book is about conflict and conflict is all about emotions. For me that is one of the most emotional scenes I have ever read. This is a story of comradery, romance, a story of loyalty and loss. This book is one of a trilogy.

Its romanticism (in contrast to the bleakness of McCarthy\\'s earlier work) brought the writer much public attention. It is also the first of McCarthy\\'s \"Border Trilogy\".The novel tells of John Grady Cole, a 16-year-old who grew up on his grandfather\\'s ranch in San Angelo, Texas. The boy was raised for a significant part of his youth, perhaps 15 of his 16 years, by a family of Mexican origin who worked on the ranch; he is a native speaker of Spanish and English. The story begins in 1949, soon after the death of John Grady\\'s grandfather when Grady learns the ranch is to be sold. Faced with the prospect of moving into town, Grady instead chooses to leave and persuades his best friend, Lacey Rawlins, to accompany him. Traveling by horseback, the pair travel southward into Mexico, where they hope to find work as cowboys. ...تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز دوم ماه ژانویه سال 2014میلادیعنوان: همه اسبهای زیبا؛ نویسنده: کورمک مکارتی؛ مترجم: کاوه میرعباسی؛ تهران، نیکا، 1390، در 416ص؛ شابک9786005906448؛ موضوع: داستانهای نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده 20مداستان در سال 1949میلادی، در «تگزاس» آغاز میگردد؛ و درباره ی کابویی شانزده ساله، به نام «جان گردی کول» است، که در آغاز داستان، با مرگ پدربزرگش، عزادار میشود؛ در این بین، مادرش تصمیم میگیرد، تا املاکشان را بفروشند، و مهاجرت کنند؛ اما «جان»، که رویای گاوچرانی، و آزادی را، در سر دارد، خانه را ترک، و به همراه دوستش، راهی «مکزیک» میشوند؛ «جان گردی کول»، و «لیسی رائولینز»، که نمی\\u200cتوانند رویاهای ماجراجویانه\\u200c شان را، در «آمریکا»ی پس از جنگ جهانی دوم، واقعیت ببخشند، «تگزاس» را ترک، و به سوی «مکزیک» می\\u200cتازند؛ این دو نوجوان، در آرزوی جشن مدام، در دل طبیعتی دست نخورده، به دوردست می\\u200cروند؛ اما این سفر پرامید، که می\\u200cبایست درس زندگی، و تجربه به آنان بیاموزد، به کابوسی دوزخی بدل می\\u200cشود...؛تاریخ 19/11/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 01/07/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی',\n",
       "   \" isn’t quite as grim as other Cormac McCarthy work that I’ve read but considering that this includes  and watching the HBO adaptation of his play , it's still so bleak that your average person will be depressed enough to be checked into a mental ward and put on suicide watch after finishing it.John Grady Cole is a sixteen year old cowboy in Texas a few years after World War II who was raised on his grandfather’s ranch after his parents split up. After his grandfather dies, the ranch is being sold off. With no where else to go, John and his best friend Lacey Rawlins ride off for Mexico. Along the way they hook up with a runaway kid who is nothing but bad news. After getting work on a large ranch, John catches the owner’s eye with his skill working with horses, but after being promoted, John falls in love with the owner’s daughter which leads to trouble for him and Rawlins.I guess you could say that this is a tragic romance or a coming-of-age story, but that’s like comparing  to the . Or saying that  is just a western. Or calling  a simple crime story. There’s a lot more going on than just a couple of kids running off to play cowboy. John and Rawlins get their eyes harshly opened to just how cruel and unforgiving the world can be and that pleasures like young love can’t possibly hope to endure in the face of that.As usual, McCarthy's views on life and death and good and evil won’t leave any sane person skipping down the street while whistling and looking for rainbows, but he’s so skilled that even his grim outlook has a kind of dark beauty to it.\",\n",
       "   '‘’The world is made of stories and these stories form cultural ideas about a place and time, such as all the mythos of the American West with ideas of heroics in hard times, gunfights, horses and living close to nature. But striping away the romanticisism reveals the reality beneath and the hard facts of life one must inevitably confront. Cormac McCarthy’s  winning novel, , blends the brutality and beauty of life in a stunning bildungsroman that strips away the mythos of the American West as the old world gives way to the modern one. 16 year old John Grady Cole is ‘’ when, distraught by his family selling the family ranch to the corporatization of oil, highways and industry creeping across the land, crosses into Mexico with friend Lacey Rawlings with his heart set on the adventure and heroisms of the cowboy mythos. But have they found paradise or have they entered a hell from which they will not make it back alive? Told in McCarthy’s ornate, signature prose and set in a threatening landscape that is practically a character on it’s own,  is a fantastic journey about border crossings: from one land to another, from naivety to understanding and from adolescence into adulthood. When  was published in 1992, buoyed by the win of the National Book Award it outsold all of McCarthy’s previous novels combined and brought the author finally into the spotlight. Not that there was anything lacking in his previous works— is often cited as a favorite—but the combination of McCarthy’s exquisite prose in a more plot-forward and less dense work has wowed critics and fans alike and it works well as an entrypoint into his works for that reason. This is a book that is difficult to put down, the writing which is practically a protagonist to overshadow his own characters takes hold on the reigns of your mind and sends you galloping into the action and intrigue that never lets up. While a few parts many feel a little far fetched, such as the multi-day prison brawl and climactic showdown, the writing and imagery is so engaging and engrossing that you’ll hardly notice. McCarthy’s prose often reads like a cross between the Old Testament and , often with a lush loquacity that can also drive succinct and direct images into the reader’s mind and also expand their vocabulary. It moves as if with the natural world it describes, never being unnecessarily verbose but always a formidable force of language.‘’As the novel opens, we find John Grady Cole mourning the loss of his grandfather, losing his girlfriend and also knowing that soon he will lose the family ranch he always hoped to inherit. While he is full of gusto and confidence, we find him to still be a starry-eyed youth constructing the facade of being ‘a Man’ than actually having achieved maturity. During his break-up when she offers to remain friends he accuses her of being ‘all talk.’ When she responds that everything is just talk he says ‘’, an early indication that he values action above all else but it is contained in a scene where he displays a lack of maturity. The novel functions as a coming-of-age tale, with Grady learning to take responsibility for his actions as he moves towards maturation. ‘’A major part of his coming-of-age, however, is the waking from the dream of the American mythos. He is drawn to Blevins, the young horse boy they meet early on in Mexico, despite Rawlings not trusting him. Grady see’s him as someone of action, something wild and embodying the cowboy mythos of living in communion with the land. With Blevins, however, we see the tough cowboy act as a quick ticket towards disaster and cracks in the mythos begin to reveal itself as juvenile. The horrific end this leads to is enough to shock anyone awake into the reality of life and death, and suddenly posturing is shown to have deadly consequences ready to snatch you from this world. It’s a scene I’ll never forget, blunt as a gunshot, and told in such a way as to leave you teeming with details that suddenly become muted in the aftershock.Much of this novel is about border crossings, a multi-functional metaphor that encompasses both physical and emotional spaces. There is also the crossing from idealization into acceptance of reality. Grady resents the loss of the myth of the American West as industrialization and modernization take over, idealizing Mexico as a fresh wilderness full of adventure he can live out his cowboy fantasies within (which, okay, a bit problematic in the ‘savage Others’ way). When Grady and Rawlins reach the ranch upon which they work, it is a sort of found Paradise to them, the promised land they had been chasing. Though along the way the land echoes different tones, depicted as threatening and violent (think the birds caught and dying in the thorns they pass). Grady’s actions, a metaphorical feasting on the forbidden fruit that is Don Hector’s daughter, Alejandra, quickly has them thrown from Paradise for their descent into Hell: prison. The book is rife with religious imagery and the crossing from Heaven into Hell, with a purgatory session in recovery later, adds a dramatic weight that comes alive and sinks its fangs into you through McCarthy’s prose.The prose does a lot of heavy lifting in this novel, where even a single word in Spanish in the dialogue is used to denote the ethnicity of a character. ‘’ says John Grady, ‘’ and in keeping with this belief, and that of action mattering more than words, McCarthy’s prose shows us what the characters are made of through how we see them respond and through the metaphorical language around them. Just as the landscape is a character in the novel, so is the language itself.‘’Perhaps the greatest lesson in accepting reality and waking from the dream of idealism comes from Dueña Alfonsa, who tells of the failed revolution and the reality that hit hard to those clinging to ideals. It isn’t to say that ideals aren’t worth fighting for, but the understanding of what can be done, what must be done to do it, and that some borders can not be crossed. ‘’ we are told, ‘’ Evil is real and will lead to death, and those familiar with McCarthy know that the unstoppable force of evil is often embodied in his novels. For Grady, this is learning that the Paradise he idealizes can never be his, but learning to love what can be his all the same. Which is the most meaningful part of this novel, that even amidst all the violence and darkness, Grady always holds on to believing in good and beauty.I enjoyed that there were so many strong women in this novel too, and that it was from women that the young men learn the truths of life. Dueña Alfonsa is a strong character, and so is Alejandra. True, much of her character exists for romantic purposes, but she is also a highly capable and strong character that even shows up the boys at riding. ‘’It can be seen that  adheres to the  narrative of the , with the boys setting out, meeting helpers, mentors, temptors and falling into the abyss where rebirth and transformation occur. The prison sequence, with Grady and Rawlins fighting for days on end, functions as the hellish catalyst for transformation. Once Grady has killed a man, heroics no longer seem so heroic. It is no longer something you do to be brave or be a hero, it is something you do because it is what you have to do. The romanticization of heroes and cowboy myths dissolve under the crushing weight of reality, life and death, and in this way we see Grady return home with a lesson under his belt. He left a youth, returned as an adult with a new found sense of self and purpose.‘’Cormac McCarthy’s  is a wild ride that tears at the fabrics of myths and tugs at our heartstrings all the same. Violent, brutal, yet deeply beautiful, this is a fascinating coming-of-age tale that goes about it in unexpected ways while teaching lasting lessons. But most of all, it is a lot of fun and has a few scenes that are forever burned into my memory. ‘’ writes McCarthy, ‘’ May the world be a place where we can thrive and appreciate the beauty even amidst all the darkness, and may you enjoy this novel as much as I did.‘’',\n",

       "  'Review': [\"Like Water for Chocolate is a popular novel, published in 1989 by Mexican novelist and screenwriter Laura Esquivel. The novel follows the story of a young girl named Tita, who longs for her lover, Pedro, but can never have him because of her mother's upholding of the family tradition: the youngest daughter cannot marry, but instead must take care of her mother until she dies.

       "   'Have you ever finished a book and thought \"Man, this is going to be hard to review?\" Because that\\'s the first thing I thought when I finished this little book by Laura Esquivel. Like Water for Chocolate: A Novel in Monthly Installments With Recipes, Romances, and Home Remedies is a book that really left me conflicted. There were things about it that I absolutely loved, and things about it that made me very angry. The only way I can think to write this review is to explain what I found good and bad, and let you all come to your own conclusions.First, let\\'s start with the good things. I loved the way this book was written. Like Water for Chocolate reads like a folktale, and a fun one at that. Some people\\'s reviews that I\\'ve read found the magical realism trite or annoying, but I found it really endearing. The book managed to be an easy, quick read without sacrificing quality. Now, I cannot review this book without talking about the recipes. The book is split up into monthly installments, and each month has a recipe that Tita makes that ties the story together. The recipe is given at the beginning of each monthly chapter, and the instructions for preparation are woven into the story. Now, I\\'m a huge fan of cooking, so I found this idea to be really great. Since so much of the story takes place around and hinges on food, putting the recipes in the book makes perfect sense. I loved the way that the preparation instructions were included in the action of the story. Some people seem to find it gimmicky, but I thought it was a fun little addition to a book already filled with the tastes and smells of good Mexican cooking.Now, for the things that troubled me. First of all, I have to admit that even though I\\'m a huge lover of all things fairy-tale and myth, I do not like the \"love at first sight\" narrative. It\\'s not that I\\'m not a romantic, but I feel that real love is something that is built up from a knowledge of a person\\'s character and personality, not something that magically happens when you see someone from across the room. As for Tita\\'s beloved, Pedro, I honestly didn\\'t like him. He spent the entire book being selfish, immature, and whiny. I have no idea what Tita saw in him. While this book started out with that \"love at first sight\" narrative, there is a point that it has the chance to go away from that narrative and treat love in a realistic and touching manner. Honestly, that was the ending I was hoping for, so I was pretty well disappointed with how the book actually ended. For me at least, the ending was the worst part of the book. I feel like it kept the book from really having any particular meaning or significance, and instead just avoided any difficulty and wrapped up as quickly and neatly as possible. It just wasn\\'t satisfying.There were also plot elements that I found really disturbing. There are some *spoilers* in the following paragraph. At one point Pedro completely ignores all concepts of consent and just assumes that Tita wants to have sex with him, even though she has denied him repeatedly because he is married to her sister and she is promised to someone else. Does he care about this? No. Is this seen as a problem in the book? No, of course not. As soon as Pedro grabs her and pulls her into a room, Tita magically forgets all of her previous objections, and it\\'s just seen as more proof that they need to be together. Honestly, I find that to be pretty wrong. If somebody who I had repeatedly told to leave me alone just assumed that I didn\\'t really mean it and that I really wanted to have sex with him and decided to pull me into a dark room, I would kick him so hard he would never want to have sex again. It wouldn\\'t matter how much I actually loved him, if he can\\'t respect my decisions he is not worth my time. Combine that incident with the not-very-sympathetic treatment of a rape victim at another point, and you can imagine that I wasn\\'t exactly happy with the way this book treated consent. *End spoilers here* Basically, this book had some incidents that left me with a bad taste in my mouth, and made me wonder exactly what kind of love the author is trying to promote.Overall, the good writing and fun recipes in this book did not outweigh the problematic elements in the narrative. As much as I wanted to, I could not let myself simply enjoy this book, because problems with the plot and the ideas in the book kept jolting me out of the magical world of the narrative. This book was supposed to be a great love story, but I couldn\\'t help feeling that Tita ended up with the wrong man. The ending of the book was completely disappointing, and only served to cement my growing discomfort. For those of you who don\\'t mind the things that I mentioned, this book could be enjoyable. For those of you who want realistic love and respectful healthy relationships, I would suggest that you stay away from Like Water For Chocolate.Rating: not recommendedGood things: enjoyable writing, fun format, successful magical realismBad things: unrealistic love, unhealthy relationships, consent problems, unsatisfying ending For more reviews, visit my blog at ',\n",
       "   \"This book was disappointing. It felt overwrought and melodramatic.Tita, the youngest daughter of overbearing Mama Elena, has to give up the hope of ever marrying. It will be her duty to take care of her mother in old age. This becomes a big problem when she meets Pedro. When Pedro learns of Tita's duty to her mother and impossibility of future marriage, he agrees to marry Tita's sister, just so he can be closer to Tita. This sets in motion this fable of unrequited love that is the thread through the book.This book, put by some, into the category of magical realism, is not at all subtle or richly textured like others in the genre. Perhaps a better category would be tall-tale or fairy tale. If I had come to the book with that perspective, maybe I would have been able to hold back on all of the exaggerated eye rolling I was doing while reading. Also, I would have been more apt to forgive the book for the delivery of one-dimensional characters.Now, I did give this book 2 stars which means it isn't completely devoid of literary value. The language, though simple and spare was evocative, the recipes and description of food interspersed between chapters was a delightful diversion.I would only recommend this book to readers who have a high tolerance for love stories that tend to the saccharine. If you're a true Cinderella girl, you might enjoy the story without concern for its plausibility. Don't bother if you're more like me--interesting in rich characters.\",\n",

       "   'I couldn\\'t help but fall for this short novel that encapsulates vividly yet simply the lives of these women in Mexico during the Pancho Villa Years. The family unit is both necessary AND a culminating curse-- it\\'s hardly fair that our heroine must not live out the life she desires but the one that is handed down to her. A stupid family tradition (it is true-- mine\\'s a bit like Tita\\'s clan, sure, though not at all) dictates that the youngest daughter gets to take care of the matriarch and never marry nor fall in love. Tita does, of course, fall in love & her longing, desperation, & hope all are ingredients for the eleven dishes she prepares and shares with the reader. More than the story itself about shitty circumstances imprisoning a beating heart & a stunting of a passion that soon after becomes nothing else but a heavy burden... the mixture of recipe with story... the book is actually revolutionary in taking a vastly different approach about the way we look at the culinary aspect our (especially us Mexicans\\') lives. Whereas I got a sour flavor disgusting my palate watching such drivel as \"Julie and Julia,\" this book (the movie does it little justice, by the way) masterfully employs a type of rare literary alchemy* by mixing elements as one would mix ingredients to give rise to something as tasty as it is nourishing.*Speaking of alchemy, it must be mentioned that this has a similar voice and tone as that of (Madonna\\'s fave!:) Paulo Coelho (\\'The Alchemist\\', \\'Veronika Decides to Die\\')... but, seriously, a WAYYY more imaginative--& therefore more enjoyable--sense of storytelling.'],\n",

       "   \"Emily Dickinson is one of my favourite poets; she is the gothic queen of poetry. At times she strongly reminds me of Edgar Allan Poe. Her poems are less macabre than Poe’s and certainly less fantastical, focusing more on human perception of the darkness and the realities of life, but her work is undoubtedly on par with his in the vein of dark romanticism. There’s just something exceedingly morose about the way in which she writes. She was terribly depressed for much of her life, and such a pessimistic attitude to life can be seen within her writing. These are the words of a woman completely disillusion with the human experience; there is little light in these poems. Humans are portrayed as weak and self-destructive; they are at times evil and even hellish in nature. All depictions are typically one sided with the darkness conquering any sense of hope. If anything hope is dead within her words. There is only one thing we are striving for in life, and that’s the end according to such thinking. Read enough of Dickinson’s poetry and you will see how obsessed with death she is; it a recurring theme across her work, one she brings up time and time again. She spent most of her life in solitude so it’s no surprise that she came up with poetry so dark in content; she had a miserable life, and it reflects in the nature of her writing: The words feel calm and almost serene, as the speaker is accepting of her mortality. She establishes the idea that death is not a choice; it just happens like life just happens. So we should just sit back and enjoy the ride, as she does in Death’s carriage. It passes through the surrounding scenery at a slow pace and observes children playing near wide open fields. This is indicative of the fact that death will come for everyone: there’s no escaping it. The speaker is only half dressed, which suggest that nobody is truly ever ready for death; it comes when it will come never mind how unprepared you are. Death waits for no man. Death is personified as a gentleman here, one who will escort her to the afterlife. Death, to Dickinson, is not the end; it is the road to immortality: the beginning. Indeed, at the end of the poem she reveals she has actually been dead for centuries (shock-horror!) We’re left with the lingering image of dead horses perpetually pushing her forward into eternity. It’s a wonderful poem, dark and gripping, ethereal and enchanting. Of all of Dickinson’s poetry, this is the one that sticks with me. Years after I first read it, I still hear the opening lines. She also characterises God as a reckless and almost careless deity. He is not the ideal that many perceive him to be. At the moment of death he fumbles at your soul; you are not elevated or taken to heaven, but “stunned” and “scalped” in the process, then struck like a “thunderbolt.” God has paws which make him sound animalistic and beastlike; he is not kind and forgiving. Death is not the end, but it doesn’t have to be a glamourous experience. Indeed, in another poem the speaker is transfixed by the buzzing of a fly as she lies on her death bed. It’s the last thing she hears; it’s her last experience on earth. In this, it abandons all glorified religious imagery, and almost portrays an ironically realistic moment. She further hints that faith only works for those that are truly devout. If you don’t really believe in it, then calling upon God’s name is pointless. She suggests that those people should look to science for the answers rather than a false bastion they don’t really believe in. Dickinson is my idea of the perfect poet. She is a religious sceptic, but she is not dismissive of a possible truth in religion. Her poetry dances between opposing ideas and it doesn’t suggest truth in either of them; thus, it is open to interpretation and debate. It can be read in different ways and through this it is profound, powerful and utterly beautiful. I love her unique style, though she’s not one that’s going to leave you feeling uplifted after reading her work that's for sure.\",\n",

       "   ' She described my needs with beauty and accuracy. That is all I need. A book. And coffee. And maybe something to eat. But mostly a book.Last weekend (weekends; the only time I can read like a maniac and write some things), I put on hold all my currently-reading books and dedicated myself to poetry. A GR friend mentioned Dickinson the other day and I remembered reading a couple of poems and a bit about her reclusive, haunted-by-death life. But I didn\\'t know her, at all. Still, I am not sure I know her now. There are so many aspects to consider. If I had to choose one word to describe her, I couldn\\'t; I would need hundreds of them. She contains multitudes, as another poet said. She seems so simple. But there is a beautiful, bittersweet complexity in her quietness. I found  and, to be honest, I was quite intimidated. So instead, I chose a \"Selected Poems\" collection. But I will definitely read that first one, entirely, someday. I only read its footnotes related to the poems I read.There are so many poems that I loved. And so many variations too. I am not going to discuss the fact that some of her poems were rewritten in order to fit the conventional rhyme of her time (atrocious). But I will mention that some of them were written in different ways by the poet herself. For example, this one that is now so close to my heart.That poem was written in 1859. There is another one written in 1862. Although the text is the same, the structure is not. Plus, a dozen of dashes and her weird capitalization. Anyway, the poem is absolutely beautiful. Poignantly beautiful. There is a person who never succeeded, a loser, and Dickinson wisely tells us that he really understands the idea of success. The person who lacks something, clearly wants that , he longs for it, and is able to get to know it so well because... he cannot touch it. He knows it better that the one who actually possesses it. In this case, success, victory. A poem I truly identify with. In conclusion, the loser acquired an unpleasant knowledge, one that stayed with him until his death. I remember a line of a song that I never listened to, saying that there is no worse nostalgia than to yearn for what never happened or never existed. An almost never-ending sorrow, a usually identifiable cause and an apparently nonexistent solution. Silver lining? You can\\'t lose what you never had. (Worst “silver lining” ever).Another one:A 1890 poem that seems to reflect Dickinson\\'s kind nature. Inspiring verses that are trying to help us find some meaning in our lives. Something that can be found when we help others. I am not sure how helpful you can be while living inside your room and not even talking to people to their faces, but at least she wrote about it...? Her poetry might have been the best and maybe the only way she had to help others.It is quite a positive poem, considering Death is one of her most recurring themes. Just to name a few: \"If I should die\", \"If I shouldn\\'t be alive\", \"Death is like the insect\", \"Because I could not stop for Death\" (one of her most well-known poems and the first one I\\'ve ever read).But I am not focusing on that theme. Enough has been said. I found other poems that are now stuck in my head. Dickinson captivated me. She gave me a new perspective on poetry. If I could describe all these feelings her work has created in me, I would feel such a huge relief; I can\\'t, though. So I must borrow some of her words: \"If I read a book [and] it makes my whole body so cold no fire ever can warm me, I know  is poetry. If I feel physically as if the top of my head were taken off, I know  is poetry.\"March 2, 2014?* Also on .',\n",

       "  'Review': ['I didn\\'t see the film so I came fresh to the book. It had a lot of impact on me because I have been in a small boat, a 34\\' catamaran in a 4 day storm out in the Atlantic before Brazil. It wasn\\'t a \\'perfect storm\\' but it was still rough, with huge seas and a constant exhausting beating against the wind. It prevented us going into , our next stop, we couldn set a course for the archipelago at all. So I could not just see but feel what a difficult position they were in. I know quite a bit about sword-fishing. I\\'ve read \\'s books. An aside - there are very few countries and vessels in the world where a woman would have the opportunity to swordfish let alone be a captain. It is an extremely physical job, setting hooks and squid bait, on spooled longlines hat run for miles and rip your fingers. The hooks are so big they could rip right through a man\\'s palm if the spool should run on. Then there is the killing of the swordfish when hauled in, gutting and icing them. As well as directing the crew, a hard-drinking group of macho men, maintaining the boat, it\\'s structure, mechanics and electronics. The electronics, depth sounders, radar and the like are not just for navigation but crucial in working out where the fish are. This was Linda\\'s strength, this finding the schools of swordfish. Not only was Greenlaw one of an infintessimally small number of women swordfishing, but she was the most successful captain of all time. Where the normal catch is 1 ton a day, for seven days straight she hauled in 5 tons each day. The money from the catch on a boat is 50% to the owner, then the expenses are taken off and a set formula applied to the rest where the captain takes the most and the newest deckhand the least. That month the deckhand took home $10,000.How do I know about swordfishing? My ex-husband was Chief Fisheries Officer and used to supervise the boats that came to fish in our waters. Because the permits they bought were limited in what they could do and the by catch could not be sold, a local would always be on the boat with them, sometimes my ex. It was all quite fascinating.Swordfish have a long, barbed extension to their jaw that is both a weapon of attack and used to slash prey fish to weaken them. When they are hauled on board alive, they are very brave and will attack to the last. They can kill a man, or almost as bad, a wound from the sword will almost always become infected and the boat might be very far in distance and time from home. There are always by-catch pulled up with the swordfish. There are the tuna. If you\\'ve only seen one dead held aloft by a fisherman it\\'s as if you\\'d only ever seen a rose browned with frost and never in it\\'s full bloom. Sailing across the ocean, three Atlantic blue fin tuna, each about 15\\' swam in front of the boat maintaining an exact distance for more than hour. They were gorgeous, a rainbow of shimmering colours like sunlight on oil, like just beneath the surface. But the tuna aren\\'t a problem, they are gutted and thrown on to the ice along with the swordfish - generally a perk of the fishermen, the boat owner doesn\\'t get a share of by-catch. The problem is the live sharks pulled up. They are vicious and their carcass is dangerous. It alone will rip the skin from a man. It\\'s not smooth, it\\'s not even sandpaper-like, it\\'s actually covered in tiny teeth, denticles. Sharks have to be shot as they being pulled up. The fishermen sometimes take the teeth as mementos and to sell. The flesh has to be thrown overboard immediately before it spoils and stinks of ammonia, piss. If shark is bled within minutes of being caught, and then iced, it is delicious. It\\'s a firm, white fish with a mild flavour. Very nice deep fried in the Trinidadian style of  with chives, thyme, garlic and hot peppers.The book was a blow-by-blow account of the storm and how it affected the crew, their family on shore, and the boat, Andrea Gale, Linda Greenlaw\\'s sister ship. Linda\\'s boat was the Hannah Boden, both owned by Alden Leeman. The boat foundered amidst terrible seas and all crew were lost and never found. It was a harrowing story, and because I knew the subject so well, I lived through it and felt it and it upset me a great deal. The author, Sebastian Junger, has that power to bring you into the story and involve you. I did enjoy it, but perhaps not in quite the way one usually uses the word \"enjoy\".',\n",
       "   '-- William Langewiesche,  On October 28, 1991, the fishing vessel  and her crew of six men disappeared off the Grand Banks in a tremendous storm created by...etc., etc. By now, everyone knows the story of this ill-fated little boat, her tiny crew, and the massive storm that swallowed them whole. The book was a bestseller the instant it came out. A blockbuster movie followed. The phrase \"a perfect storm\" is the most-overused shorthand phrase in our culture (for awhile I thought it might be overtaken by \"Wall Street verses Main Street,\" but alas, the election is over, and storms without imperfection are back in vogue). Once upon a time, though, before George Clooney grew a great beard and drove his boat up a mountain-sized CGI wave,  was simply a sharp bit of journalism. Sebastian Junger found a newspaper clipping about the \\'s fate, went to Gloucester with pen and pad, and delved into the lives of her crew, entering a normally taciturn and reticent community to show us their lives before their deaths. (It\\'s worth remembering that Junger\\'s book came out long before the History Channel abdicated it\\'s purported mission to bring us  and  and before the Discovery Channel presented  and  and yes, . Nowadays, celebration of blue-collar life is a cultural norm; it wasn\\'t always that way). Almost from the first sentences, Junger - who has now morphed into a semi-self-righteous, self-styled Homer of Afghanistan - shows he has an excellent grasp of place: The Discovery Channel\\'s  - of which I am a huge fan - has turned a spotlight on the lives of fishermen. We see these grizzled tough guys in all their rotgut swilling, chain-smoking, foul-mouthed glory. At the time this was written, though, Junger\\'s work was revelatory. He presented them as iconoclasts; men who lived entirely in moments. They could go out on a boat for a couple of weeks, make a big score, blow thousands of dollars in a couple days, and go right back out on the ocean to do it again. Junger finds a way to celebrate these lives without neglecting the broken marriages, child support orders, and limited windows within which these men could succeed. After introducing us to the doomed - Billy Tyne, Michael Moran, Dale Murphy, Alfred Pierre, Bobby Shatford, and David Sullivan - Junger sets out to sea. This is where things could have gotten very tricky. See, very little is known about what happened to the . There were no survivors. No mayday calls. The EPIRBs never activated. Attempts to locate the wreckage on the ocean floor have so far failed. All we have is an empty ocean and miles to fill with supposition. There are only two ways to write this story. First, Junger could have accepted he did not have enough material for a book, and allowed this tale to remain as a long-form article, which is how it began (the article is called , published in  magazine). Or two, he could write a book in which the central event can only be hypothesized. Junger chose the latter, and having read many disaster books since, I can see he chose a route fraught with peril (relative to the craft of writing, of course). With so little upon which to hang the central narrative, Junger has no choice but to pad the book with digressions and to shift the story away from the  and to other, luckier boats caught in the storm. Done poorly, this tact would have left me resentful that I\\'d been sold a bill of goods. Somehow, though, he pulls it off. This is kind of a surprise. Something about Sebastian Junger just calls out to be disliked. Maybe it\\'s his chiseled jaw, perfectly symmetrical face, and artfully cultivated five o\\'clock shadow. Maybe it\\'s the scent of young-French-nobleman that he gives off; a willingness to thrust himself into new worlds with both curiosity and entitlement (this is, unfortunately, a strong undercurrent in his flat collection of stories entitled , a book notable today for a cameo made by former Northern Alliance leader Ahmad Massoud, whose assassination by al Qaida was prepatory to the 9/11 attacks). Junger is both everyman and know-it-all. He can swill Wild Turkey while still cogitating on fluid dynamics, long-line fishing, and the science of drowning. There’s a whiff of Cliff Clavin about him, sitting at the end of the bar, half in the bag, telling all the neighborhood drunks that their deeply held views about Afghanistan are ill-conceived. Except unlike Cliff, Junger is probably right, which makes him a little less likeable. His saving grace is his ability to write. Like the best journalists, Junger writes clearly, includes telling details, and manages to convey difficult concepts - like the physics of waves - in a way that makes you feel better because you can understand them. He also knows all the emotional beats, and hits every one. Junger intuits just where to place a single, short sentence such as \"no one got off alive\" in order to induce chills. For instance, I\\'ve never forgotten the section of  that tells you how someone drowns:Theories about what happened to the , no matter how well-reasoned and detailed, could not have supported  in book-length. There needed to be a B-story. Here, Junger chooses to highlight the heroics and plight of the Coast Guard\\'s parajumpers, an elite squad of the best swimmers on Earth (and also the subject of the Kevin Costner vehicle, , which despite Ashton Kutcher\\'s presence, is not nearly as bad as you think). These parts of the book are tense, white-knuckled, and agonizing, since unlike the foreordained fate of the \\'s crew, you have no idea who is going to live and who is going to die.  is one of my favorite books. It is, as the subheading announces, a story of men against the sea. In other words, it\\'s a sea yarn (perhaps my favorite yarn genre), and Junger is a great raconteur. He pulls together a number of different threads - science, literature, the Bible, various sea stories - to form a single, powerful piece. It is a bit of audaciousness that pays off. As I read this, I pictured Junger as my narrator, my own personal Marlow, wearing a flannel shirt and sitting at the end of a dark Gloucester bar with smoke-stained walls and a swordfish hung over the fireplace. He strokes his perfect stubble while sipping Scotch neat. Outside, an autumn gale is raging, pelting the windows with rain. In the distance, a foghorn sounds mournfully. Junger begins to speak in his gruff-yet-Wesleyan-educated voice. The story is about men who go out in boats, and about the seemingly-infinite sea, which - like the Universe - never ceases to awe, no matter how small the rest of the world gets; the story tells of the power of waves and the dark spray-swept terror and the loneliness of death and the men out on the ocean who vanish, and whose lives are memories and whose deaths are mysteries.',\n",
       "   '“How do men act on a sinking ship? Do they hold each other? Do they pass around the whisky? Do they cry?” October 1991 - It was \"the perfect storm\"Most of us have seen the movie. I have watched it many times and was inspired to read this book for a reading challenge. I found it to be well written, thoughtful, educational, moving and heart breaking. The amount of research that went into the writing of this book is impressive. Junger did his homework and it shows. If you are expecting the book to be like the movie you watched, you will be a little disappointed. This book not only introduces you to the doomed men who set sail on the Andrea Gail, it also tells the story of other boaters, their near misses, a helicopter going down, rescues, the dangers of hurricanes, the ships that sunk and the dangers of fishing.\"Fishing continues to be one of the easiest ways in which to die while earning a paycheck.\"This book also educates the reader on swordfish fishing, weather reports, wave heights, the equipment on the Andrea Gail, rogue waves, missing ships, and what happens in your body when you drown. Some may find the beginning of the book to be a little dry, but I was fascinated with it. Who knew I found fishing and boats so interesting? Plus, he is giving us a glimpse into the life of the crew. It also feels weird to say that I enjoyed this book which dealt with tragedy. I thought it was very well done and told the story of known things that occurred when the crew and their boat went missing. We know that the crew did not survive. Junger cannot tell us what happened on the Andrea Gail during the storm, but he does give a good account of what happened before, after and what others reported experiencing during the storm. \"Whatever it is, one thing is know for sure.

The primary story follows the crew of the Andrea Gail:The early part of the book is reminiscent of Moby Dick as you learn the ins and outs of sword fishing. During this point it runs a fine line between being fascinating or dragging. Luckily, it is nowhere near as long as Moby Dick so it serves as a nice introduction to the atmosphere of the story.Then the storm hits:During the storm part of the book there are several tales of heroic rescues and tragic losses. While the focus at first is on the Andrea Gail, there are many other interesting stories from the North Atlantic.If you like non-fiction, harrowing tales of nature’s wrath, and stories about people pushed to the very limits of endurance, then I highly recommend this book. Just be sure to bring along your Dramamine! ',\n",
       "   'This is the heartbreaking true account of the last moments of those aboard the fateful last voyage of the Andrea Gail, the swordfish boat caught in the heart of the ocean during one of the worst storms to hit the North American eastern seaboard, in October 1991.This book was more of a factual account, attempting to recreate the last days and the possible thoughts and actions of those who sadly lost their lives, rather than an attempt to fictionalize their story. Junger never lets his reader forget that this is a true-life description; achieving this with passages from meteorologists, other fishermen and the loved ones left to mourn those lost at sea. Whilst being dense in the science of storms and the process of life on board a fishing schooner, it is also thick with tragedy and truly does justice to the lost men who can now never be forgotten.'],\n",

       "  'Review': ['Among other things you get great stuff from Palast as he exposes the election fraud during the 2000 Presidential election that ultimately decided the outcome of the race, the attached strings that come with IMF \"bailouts\", Pat Robertsons hypocritical money making scams, the CIA/Kissinger/Corporate engineered coup in Chile, Wal-Mart using Chinese prison slave labor while at the same time promoting themselves as a squeaky clean all American entity, the Exxon Valdez oil spill and clean up, the horror of Wackenhut privatized prisons, Pfizer knowingly selling defective heart valves, etc. He also is like Michael Moore in that he does a good job at using humor in his journalistic work even while exposing some very nasty things. Palast is Jewish and comes from the left so while you get good exposures of corporate shenanigans you also have to put up with the typical hypocritical anti-white snipes that comes from that demographic. Like at one point Palast mocks a cab driver that is worried about too many immigrants coming into England and says he wants to preserve his English culture and heritage. Palast then equates English culture with drunken football hoologanism and says that the English should be begging to add new material to their gene pool! So for all the good work he has done Palast can\\'t seem to shake the Jewish leftist tendency to hate working class whites. If it wasn\\'t for that I may have given this book five stars.',\n",
       "   'The Best Democracy Money Can Buy by Greg Palast is a fascinating, eye-opening and disturbing collection of investigative journalism. Greg Palast is an investigative journalist, who is currently working for the BBC and The Guardian. He formerly worked fighting corporations with Labor Unions and consumer groups. He brings his investigative experience from these organizations to uncover greed, avarice, and injustice the world over. He is probably most well know for uncovering the voting shenanigans in Florida during the last election, which makes of the first chapter of this book. His documentation is meticulous, and his style is straight forward and to the point.He takes on the Bush family and the corporations (i.e. Enron) and countries (i.e. Saudi Arabia) that have supported them throughout their political lives. He also has a lot to say about deregulation of power, which has significant relevance in light of the recent blackout in the northeast. He also shows how the IMF, World Bank, and WTO have had a negative impact on developing economies and challenges the globalization. Of course he devotes a full chapter to corporate America. In another chapter, he goes after Pat Robertson and Pepsi Cola among others.Furthermore he provides a handy appendix for \"your turn-resources for action.\" In that section he lists organizations that are fighting against injustices all over as well as suggestions as to what people can do to get involved.',\n",

Charles Schumer.\\xa0At this point an almost imperceptible smile creeps up on Mr. Bernanke's face and right at that moment I'm sure we are both thinking the same thing-\\xa0Because it is not really in China's interests at all to revalue its currency, it will not benefit the Chinese economy, and most importantly its not reasonable to expect the Chinise to take into consideration what benefits the american economy whilst making policy decisions. \\xa0This is a master class in Doublethink and self deception. In this case you see Schumer equating America's interests to China's and going on to argue that the chinise must therefore be asinine to not advance a policy that benefits America - it's a no brainer....or is it?\\xa0Let's not forget that China is the fastest-growing major economy in the world, and has had the fastest growing major economy for the past 30 years with an average annual GDP growth rate of over 10%. Last year, in the midst of a global recession China's GDP grew by over 11%. You could argue that from China's point of view it's doing everything right and should continue pegging it's currency to the dollar. \\xa0\\xa0To be honest -in the words of the author - 'who gives a shit?' if Americans are stealing their own elections, illegally removing African Americans of the registered voters list, removing regulations aimed at protecting consumers then charging up to 300% on electricity in states like Florida, and are unwilling to investigate the Bin Laden family's business deals with the Bush family?\\xa0But that was just the starter, as soon as Greg Palast moves his narrative on to the World Bank/IMF in South America and Africa I am seriously pissed off. \\xa0The level of deception perpetuated by these global money launderers has always been my one soft spot and Greg Palast wasted no time in exposing the truth.\\xa0I will not cheapen his book by trying to summarize the economic policies of the World Bank/IMF/WTO/IAB, it's Poverty Reduction Strategy, Country Assistance Strategy and it's Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). All in all the World Bank/IMF and it's subsidiaries condemn people to death and take over governments without firing a single bullet. This is modern day colonialism. Please open wide and swallow the economic medicine, it will definitely kill your economy. \\xa0 \\xa0Back to the comitee meeting, Sen. Schumer is a reasonably smart man, why would he assume that China would revalue it's currency during a global recovery \\xa0at the expense of its exports?Why, because the U.S, just like western Europe always assumes that there is only one correct perspective and forgets that other nations have their own national interests.\\xa0This book asks you to question the motives behind foreign policy and the absolute hypocrisy of\\xa0Globolization.\\xa0Greg Palast is really good at what he does. This is what investigative reporting looks like - follow the paper trail all the way to the end and then keep going. It's unfortunate I didn't read it when it was published in 2002. \\xa0\"],\n",

       "  'Review': ['There could be thirteen million things to write about this book - but since I\\'m \\'retired\\'.....only writing abbreviated reviews- I\\'ll try to make this short. This novel must have been one of the most scandalous- talked about novels - to hit the book shelves back in 1977. And..... it was a *FINE* read these past few days!!!!! By *FINE*, I mean a VERY ADDICTIVE compelling engrossing WONDERFUL read.....an epic that stretches our hearts beyond the Outback regions of Australia. Tidbits.........The relationship between Father Ralph de Bricassart and Meggie Cleary calls for a lengthy book club discussion- in itself!! Father Ralph says: \"I\\'ve known Meggie since she was ten years old, only days off the boat from New Zealand. You might in truth say I\\'ve known Meggie through flood and fire and emotional famine, and through death, and life. All that we have to bear. Meggie is the mirror in which I\\'m forced to view my mortality\". .....A theme that never got off the ground: Early in this novel, when Meggie was a small child - in school with the nuns- she became friends with a little black girl. Racial tensions between the families grew out of injustice when Meggie had lice in her hair. We soon move into part II of the novel. All we learned was the black family had to \\'move\\'. I thought we\\'d see more \\'racial\\' injustice stories - but this novel never followed that path. .....One of my favorite characters was Frank..... \\'the way\\' we discover his where-a-bouts years later was so darn sad. The \\'worsening psychosis\\' news comes with no background story. I was left hanging \\'too\\' long. Frank was often in my thoughts... I wanted more of him. His love for his mother, Fee, and only sister Meggie reminded me of \\'what\\'s right\\' in life. But I wanted more of \\'that\\' too- Yet so much tragedy-no Peace Frank\\'s father - Paddy - while growing up. Sad... just sad! .....Mary Carson - sister of Paddy, ( Meggie\\'s father) -was one hell of a nice lady -- ha!!!! A narcissistic snake! lol\"The good die young\"... was the only sentence that brought me to tears - the scene with Dane.. was pretty emotional- and that damn sentence \"the good die young\" is once of those sentences that can piss me off - fast - if in \\'the moment\\' of grief. My dad died young. I\\'m not sure I find that sentence comforting \\'at all\\'! Justine- As unfair as I felt she was \\'emotionally\\' loved by her mother- Meggie...she was my least favorite character in the book too. And... for no real reason - she didn\\'t do anything wrong --( I did like her relationship with her brother) -- but I was too interested in other characters, more. I could go on and on and on.....It\\'s filled with drama, tabu themes, forbidden love, angst, secrets, love, family, marriage, illness, death, loyalty, money, religion, sex, - heartbreaking and affirmative... gorgeously written - master-storytelling!! Thanks for all the - many friends here who encouraged me to read this!! I\\'m thrilled I did!!!',\n",
       "   \"This might sound strange, but I crave a book that is going to ruin me for all other novels to come. And this was it! Something in my greedy little reader paws, wants a book that is going to destroy me. Wreak havoc upon me. Do you know what I am talking about? Well, maybe you don't. Hmph.This story lifted my heart and made my soul come alive. I felt as if the characters ingratiated themselves to such an extent in my very being, that I had sensations of them dancing upon my soul. With that being said, there is something that you must know and accept before beginning this novel. These events would never, could never, happen in real life. Therefore, just go with it. Enjoy the story. Suspend belief. Do whatever you need to do.. because once you do, you will have a reading experience unlike any you've ever had before. This is a story you will never forget.  So.. what are you waiting for? Why are you still reading this review? Um..?I've recently been informed that this author has supported and condoned the rapes that have been occurring on Pitcairn Island located in the South Pacific. I cannot stand by and be silent, and I certainly cannot and will not endorse that point of view. In fact, I think it is horrific.

       "   '\\u200f\\u202b\\u202dThe Thorn Birds is a 1977 best-selling novel by the Australian author Colleen McCullough. Set primarily on Drogheda—a fictional sheep station in the Australian Outback named after Drogheda, Ireland—the story focuses on the Cleary family and spans the years 1915 to 1969. The novel is the best selling book in Australian history, and has sold over 33 million copies worldwide. Meghann \"Meggie\" Cleary, a four-year-old girl living in New Zealand in the early twentieth century, is the only daughter of Paddy, an Irish farm labourer and Fee, his harassed but aristocratic wife. Meggie is a beautiful child with curly red-gold hair but receives little coddling and must struggle to hold her own. Her favourite brother is the eldest, Frank, a rebellious young man who is unwillingly preparing himself for the blacksmith\\'s trade. He is much shorter than his other brothers, but very strong. Unlike the other Clearys, he has black hair and eyes, believed to be inherited from his Maori great-great-grandmother. ...عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «م\\u200dرغ\\u200dان\\u200c ش\\u200dاخ\\u200dس\\u200dار طرب\\u200c»؛ «آخ\\u200dری\\u200dن\\u200c پ\\u200dرن\\u200dده\\u200c در ش\\u200dاخ\\u200dه\\u200c ای\\u200c ت\\u200dن\\u200dه\\u200dا»؛ «آخ\\u200dری\\u200dن\\u200c پ\\u200dرن\\u200dده\\u200c»؛ «پرنده خارزار»؛ «مرغان خارزار»؛ و «م\\u200dرغ\\u200c خ\\u200dار»؛ نویسنده: کالین مک کالو؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش: ماه نوامبر سال 2006میلادیعنوان: مرغان شاخسار طرب، نویسنده: کالین مک کالو؛ مترجم: فرشته طاهری؛ تهران، انتشارات ویس؛ 1367؛ در 791ص؛ چاپ دوم 1368؛ سوم سال 1369؛ بعدا نشر درسا)؛ موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان استرالیا - سده 20معنوان: مرغ خار، نویسنده: کالین مک کالو؛ مترجم: طاهره صدیقیان-رویا صدوقی، نشر مروارید 1369؛ در 368ص؛عنوان: پرنده خارزار، نویسنده: کالین مک کالو؛ مترجم: مهدی غبرایی، نشر نیلوفر 1371؛ در 764ص؛عنوان: پرندگان خارزار، نویسنده: کالین مک کالو؛ مترجم: امیر راسترو، نشر قصه پرداز 1379؛ در 568ص؛عنوان: مرغان شاخسار طرب، نویسنده: کالین مک کالو؛ مترجم: تیمور قادری- زهرا قادری، نشر ابرسفید 1391؛ در 736ص؛در پهنه ی گیتی مرغکی است که تنها یکبار در زندگی خویش آواز میخواند؛ آوایی دلنشینتر از آواز هر مخلوق دیگری در گستره خاک؛ از آن دم که ترک آشیانه میگوید خاربنی را میجوید، و تا آن را نیابد، آرام نمیگیرد؛ چو آن را یافت، در میان شاخسار گزنده مینشیند و میخواند، و خود را بر فراز بلندترین و تیزترین شاخه ی خار مصلوب میکند، و در واپسین لحظه های زندگی در سوگ خویش بلند آوازتر از بلبل و چکاوک نغمه سرایی میکندداستان دختری به نام «مگی» است که عاشق کشیشی به نام «رالف» می\\u200cشود و در اثر یک رابطه جنسی از «رالف» پسری به دنیا می\\u200cآورد؛ کتاب «پرنده خارزار»، داستان سه نسل از خانواده ی «کلیریس» را باز میگوید؛ گله دارانی که از سرزمینی زیبا و سرسخت، زندگی طلب میکنند و همزمان با دلخوریها، ضعفها و اسراری روبرو میگردند که به خانواده شان نیز راه مییابدتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 19/07/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 13/06/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی',\n",
       "   'This beaut of a soap opera has been around for decades & for excellent reason. Epics have been forgotten & currently authors satisfy their readers (or not, as the case may be) with smaller stories & smaller lives.McCullough has the tenacity to include three generations in this sprawling saga, and as family portraits usually tell of differences between the generations PLUS the ties that bind them together & to a home, this one exactly does that in an extremely entertaining fashion.Fee marries her second choice, not the man of her dreams, and becomes pregnant with more or less the number of digits one has in both hands; she lives a quiet & ironically isolationist existence. Her daughter Meggie, the protagonist until her daughter takes the helm, also suffers her mother\\'s character flaws... fate plus genes a maudling story make. Her priest Ralph, in what is the central love story, chooses God over his heart. The same is not repeated but is indeed echoed in the last generation as Justine, who finally breaks the curse, leaves the warmth and monotony of her family in Drogheda to actually take flight & follow her instincts which had failed the Cleary women in the past.There are only 19 chapters in this massive chronology and many events occur, mostly random and sometimes poetic, but they never fail to surprise. There are so many characters, & all of them, you feel, actually employ humanity, act like actual persons that may have lived. There are acts of stupidity and compassion. People repress many feelings, more for personal convictions than for social or familial obligations we seldom don\\'t visit in books such as these!Ralph is an idiot for causing so much pain to both he and his love. What does that say about organized religion and the crimson-clothed of the almighty Vatican? The Clearys, though not intelligent mainly because of the collective \"Irish pauper\" mentality the patriarchal figure bestows upon his offspring (Papa Cleary and Ralph\\'s proxy, Luke pretty much F*** things up for the rest). They are, however, extremely hard workers and this pays off well. There are many morals, many moments of euphoria, and even slight (by today\\'s standards) snippets of hot erotica! You pretty much stand witness to one of the most complex yet endearing pieces of literature.Highlights: 1) the death of one of the Cleary boy\\'s via warthog asphyxiation immediately following the death of his father via fiery \"holocaust.\" 2) Ralph meeting his love at her retreat where she is in isolation is definately one of the most romantic notions I have ever read... it is written with the finest sense of what love really is. 3) learning what \"French Letters\" mean. 4) transition from New Zealand to Australia to Rome, Greece, London. Such sprawls indicate that life can expand from its moldy origins to experience infinite possiblities, arrive at distal ends.I recommend this book for someone not afraid to having a two-three week relationship with a soap opera that, unlike those on t.v., does not insult the audience with romantic cliches or expected \"disasters.\" The novel is organic: a testament of lives that experience pain and pleasure. The reader only experiences the latter.',\n",

Of ‘d*mning the torpedoes’ and sailing ‘full speed ahead.’ Of getting up off the dirty floor, dusting yourself off, and getting back into the fray.For in 1980 I was in the very THICK of the Soup.My meds were an obnoxious fallback for my stress and I HATED my job. At times that autumn - the only time it ever happened to me - I felt almost suicidal. I was at the proverbial end of my rope...Then I read this calamitous set of hopeless misadventures set in the Australian outback. It gripped me till the end.You know, I had everything: a wonderful fiancé, good friends, and I had just secured a promotion. And this job was it. So what was the problem?Well, I worked in an Automated Supply Cell.

I needed H-E-L-P!!!So, there I was, up crap creek without a paddle, and on my coffee breaks I poured my soul into The Thorn Birds. I guess misery really DOES love company.But The Thorn Birds, above all, is a Fantastically HUMAN book, though it can singe your soul. And that’s why it clicked for me.It showed me REAL LIFE AS IT IS.Straight - no chaser, as Thelonius Monk once said.The Thorn Birds LIVES. It BREATHES.It’s FLESH & BLOOD writing.The same as my newly-restored Faith - with all of its faults and blemishes and, yes!

       "  'Review': ['I’ve been a registered Democrat since high school and many of my values are liberal, but this was awful. This book is an example of atrocious holier-than-thou thinking, with humor that is meaner than it is funny, and blind where it should be practical. It’s propaganda for people who already believe the cause and contributes nothing to discussion. It’s every bit as spiteful and unreasonable to its opposition as the vilified super-conservatives. It makes me wonder if people like Franken and Ann Coulter aren’t in this for money, as championship of polar values gets them easy praise and tons of cash. I found the epilogue, about the Democrats taking Congress and righting all the wrongs of the country to be the most amusing part of the book. When we actually saw how little the Democratic Congress (which I helped with my vote into office) did, it was like one final nail, heavier than all the others, driven through this paperback. Now that they control the presidency and both houses of Congress, with Franken in their company, maybe some of his righteous prophecy can come true. Until then, do yourself a favor and pick up an informative book like  or  instead, books intended to give you information so you can form your own opinions. Mean spirited humor meant to demean those we disagree with only hurts national discourse, no matter which “other” is being attacked.',\n",
       "   '\"Grown-up love means actually understanding what you love, taking the good with the bad and helping your loved one grow.” ― Al Franken, Lies & the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair & Balanced Look at the Right4.5 stars.I guess one\\'s enjoyment of this depends on how much they like Al Franken.This was the first book I’ve read by him and I found it to be a warm, human and utterly hilarious read. Al takes on FOX News in this this book, in particular Bill O’Reilly.This book has a very interesting back story as supposedly Fox News sued Franken in court over the words \"Fair and Balanced\" which I find to be utterly hysterical. And yes it is discussed in the book. I suppose I can see why conservatives might get pissed off at this book but even if you’re not an ultra liberal this does make for fun reading. Franken brings up a lot of things that are really on point. George Bush was president when this came out. Franken brings his wit through the book, to be sure, but the thing is: lots of stuff in this book make so much sense. I loved his \"Lawyer and the waitress\" story.I personally love reading political nonfiction books to get all viewpoints and I happen to be a fan of Franken. If you are seeking a good political Non Fiction book, this is a great one AND there is nothing about Trump because he was a long way from being president when this came out. (Sigh..resisting the urge to say something Snarky about now).Whatever your views on Franken, he is not and never has been, boring. And he just makes one laugh while at the same time making you think. I would give this 4.5 stars. Highly recommended.',\n",
       "   \"I would recommend this book to intellectual conservatives so that they simply have more ammo to disassociate themselves from the neo-cons. I actually respect true conservative thought and this administration was not it. At all. And Franken gives a funny, sometimes enraging, flogging of the neo-con media.It's a great book. I think, however, it preaches to the choir since the person who would read this is a liberal to begin with in the first place.And he DESTROYS Ann Coulter and Bill O'Reilly...this, in and of itself, are good things...\",\n",
       "   'This very funny but extremely serious book goes after the deliberate falsehoods perpetrated by the right-wing on \"liberals.\"As you may know, the Fox Network went after Franken for trademark infringement because he used the phrase \"fair and balanced.\" The judge threw out the suit as completely ludicrous and made several trenchant comments about the inability of the Fox executives to recognize satire when they saw it.Harvard University gave Franken a fellowship to basically do whatever he wanted, but demurred at his idea of having Harvard students write his son\\'s college application. Franken finally hit upon the idea of having a group of students do research for his book. They bought the idea.His first target is Ann Coulter, author of Scandal. Franken methodically picks apart her book, revealing it for the inaccurate, if not disingenuous, piece of nonsense it is. He also shows how she has blatantly lied about things. Her Connecticut driver\\'s license shows her birth date as 1961; her Washington DL says 1963. She claims the Washington DL is correct, which means she voted as a sixteen-year-old. On one of the applications she lied about her age. Now, many people have done that, but since the US Patriot Act makes it a felony to put false information on a government ID, she could be whisked away and held without counsel for a long time. I wish they would. Simple charges she makes in her book were never checked. For example, she complains that Evan Thomas, supposedly one of those heinous liberals, was the son of Norman Thomas, four-time [sic:] candidate for president on the Socialist party ticket. Actually, he ran six times, and a simple phone call to Evan Thomas reveals that he is not the son of Norman Thomas. Coulter\\'s book is filled with such false details. Either she is extremely lazy or a blatant liar. Franken obviously suspects the latter.Francken has infuriated that scion of right-wing Fox Bill O\\'Reilly by publicly pointing out many untruths that O\\'Reilly has put forth. At Book Expo in Los Angeles, O\\'Reilly was humiliated by Franken, who categorically listed all sorts of lies O\\'Reilly had perpetrated on the public. Now, Franken makes clear that occasionally making a mistake on a statistic is hardly a crime, but O\\'Reilly\\'s customary tactic, when challenged with the correct information from unimpeachable sources is to simply bully and yell at his challenger rather than correct the mistake. The problem is also that he makes lots of mistakes. More from the \"sewer of right-wing dishonesty. When he interviewed the son of a worker killed on 9/11 on February 4th, 2003, he became enraged at the son\\'s opposition to the war in Iraq, had his engineer cut off the man\\'s microphone, and sent him packing saying to him after the show\\'s end, \"Get out of my studio before I tear you to f*cking pieces.\"O\\'Reilly, who constantly rails at the lyrics of rap songs, wrote a murder mystery in 1998, Those who Trespass (about a serial killer who murders everyone who interferes with his rising television career), that took explicit sex and violence to new heights and the English language to new lows. In one murder, the victim is killed by having a spoon driven through the roof of her mouth into her brain stem. Variants of the \"F\" word and \"B\" word are used more than 51 times. Case of the pot calling the kettle black? O\\'Reilly is not a nice man.Team Franken took a look at Hannity\\'s (of Hannity and Colmes,) book to verify the factualness of his statements. Examples of disingenuousness and dishonesty abound.Bush\\'s initial indifference to al Qaeda prior to 9/11 is astonishing. The Clinton administration had developed plans for eliminating Bin Laden, but those plans were ignored. That the Bin Laden family were good friends with the Bush family is well-known, and Franken speculates as to what might have happened to Clinton had he been so nice to the Bin Laden family, permitting a Saudi plane to fly around the country picking up family members for return to Saudi Arabia, while American airplanes were grounded. In the meantime, President Bush has broken all presidential records for the number of days spent on vacation.The book is often uneven, some parts funnier and some more serious. Should one laugh or cry learning that many of our leaders today, Cheney, Wolfowitz, Perle, Bush, and other chickenhawks who are sending men off to die in war, did everything in their power, having their fathers pull strings and inventing flimsy excuses (shouldn\\'t pick on Limbaugh, I think he was just too fat) to avoid service in Vietnam. ',\n",
       "   'Why I love this book: 1) Definitely one of the funniest book titles I\\'ve ever seen2) Remember when, for years after 9/11, so many media and entertainment figures held themselves back from criticizing Bush administration? Al broke the silence quite a bit with this book, which was basically a \"bullshit\" cry heard \\'round the country. After that it seemed to be way more ok for others to start speaking out. You may think he\\'s too moderate but he\\'s pretty clever at calling bullshit on the right.3) There was some really hilarious controversy surrounding this book when it came out. Bill O\\'Reilly got in a fight with Al over this book in a heated exchange at a major Book Expo. The details of this fight are hilarious. Also Fox tried to SUE him for using the \"fair and balanced\" phrase in his subtitle. What happened is, the judge told the Fox representatives in court that the were full of shit and in over their heads and the case was I think literally laughed out of court4) His sense of humor is very unique '],\n",

       "   \"This was a mixed bag for me. The positives are that D'Este is comprehensive in his research, provides a ton of sources to corroborate ideas, and is impartial throughout. These are all important things for providing worthwhile historical accounts of real events. The negatives are that D'Este focuses way too much on strategy rather than actual actions and what the events were like, he gets bogged down in providing a dozen corroborating sources when only three or four are needed, and he manages to strip away all of the emotion and drama of the events. It was informative but I prefer accounts that draw me in.\",\n",
       "   'This is not a history of the Normandy campaign; rather, it’s an examination of the command decisions and some, not all, of the operations within. Of the landings, only Sword Beach is covered in detail. The taking of Cherbourg is not covered; we just know it happened. I wish the Cobra breakthrough received a more detailed accounting. It may help a reader to look at Wikipedia, or read Hastings’ or Beevor’s accounts before to learn more of the whole campaign.The author critically examines General Montgomery and the British army’s actions during this campaign and finds much to fault. The army suffers from failure of coordination and a lack of manpower at the strategic level. The author takes Monty to task with an in-depth examination of what he claimed to do, or was going to do, and what he actually did. There was a difference! Chapter 26 on the Falaise action (or lack of it) was hard to follow, yet the failure to close the pocket wasn’t fatal. So what’s the point? The campaign was finally a success, wasn’t it? True, it didn’t enhance Monty’s reputation, but the author gives him points for his overall excellence in training and planning. Readers familiar with Alamein and the action at the Mareth Line know that Monty could flex when he needed to. There were times when I wondered this could be as mean-spirited as David Irving’s , yet overall there is enough excellent history of the command decisions that had to be made to make this book well worth reading.',\n",
       "   \"There is detail here and to the extent that the book explores the decision making process that formed a battle plan, and then evaluates how it played out, it is thought provoking for those interested in military strategy. However as others have surely said, there is a repetitive refrain here about how FoS Monty was, that comes back again and again. It would be an interesting if tiresome exercise to pick out how many times we are re-informed in a single-line sentence that Monty was inclined to arrange the facts to fit the story he wished to put forward. As if the reader needed to be reacquainted with the thesis statement periodically, just in case he forgot the thrust of case being built throughout so many sections of the book.I'm no expert in the field, but there does appear to be a trend in scholarship in harmony with what seemed to be Monty's long lived quest after the war - to rewrite the common evaluation of his generalship more favorably. This book is steadfastly, repetitively on the other side of that argument.Having said that, no one including D'Este sees Monty as any sort of massive failure as a strategist in what was ultimately a successful invasion and break out. And really, how much fault lies with the commander when the battle plans are implemented in such a way that the objectives are not met, as was the case in many operations aimed at taking Caen? It does seem that Monty was an inveterate fudger, spinner, slanter and credit taker throughout his career and his inconsistencies with facts on the ground appear to be whoppers. Hard not to concede that there was a pattern there. But what we may sometimes fail to appreciate is that his was a thankless job with many factors to balance (Ike-like, if you will) including war weariness at home and on the line, a man power shortage (however you regard the claim/efficacy of the 100k reserve on the British mainland), an incredible ability on the part of the enemy to resist in the face of dwindling resources and unprecedented bombardment and...general heavy sledding as regards of the taking of objectives. Plus, with the end of the war on the horizon, no one above him in the UK establishment would have welcomed boat rocking or anything that would weaken their hand in post war negotiations. What he did do was keep the situation together in a way that bent but did not break - he prevented disaster - so that the inexorable build up of numbers close to the coast where the allies could exercise the key tactical advantages of air superiority/naval and artillery bombardment would eventually reveal the opportunity for a coup de grâce and win the day. Be that as it may, a good and informative book on the Normandy invasion if you can tolerate the repetitious, unvarying barrage of criticism of the manner of Monty's fighting and, more to the point, characterizing the war.\"],\n",

       "  'Review': ['Poor Malachy McCourt. When his book came out, the critics said, “He’s not Frank.” Goodreads reviewers echoed the same sentiment. But I don’t think there was much rivalry between them. They shared their fame the same way they pooled money to bring their younger brothers and mother over to the States. Their first writing project was a collaboration - a two-man play I haven’t read yet. And then came the books, which include some interesting overlaps. Malachy depicts Frank as a real gentleman, which comes across in Frank’s own books and the interviews available on Youtube. Frank depicts the child Malachy as a “dote” who could charm any roomful of people and the life of every party in adulthood. That outgoingness  comes across in this book, and also, in any interview with Malachy you might want to catch on Youtube.So it’s true that this book does not have the literary grace of Frank’s books, but my gosh, it’s funny! It’s also a bit ribald; Malachy tells you all about “sampling the fleshpots” in his travels from India to Europe. For that reason, I should probably put it on my “Regrettable Reads” shelf, but I can’t regret anything that made me laugh that hard. Frank’s books also made me laugh hard, but not as much as this. The man who drives me to work wondered, “What are you reading back there?” So I’m definitely looking forward to the resolution of Malachy’s story with his next memoir: how he got sober and lived happily ever after.',\n",
       "   \"If you can find any interest into Malachy McCourt's endless pursuit for drinking, promiscuity and living a full-fledged hedonistic lifestyle, then this is the book for you.Beyond that, he only demonstrates how reprehensibly immoral he is with respect to his treatment of marriage, and more so his dedication to his children. If there is any redemption to be attained on his part, he certainly does not make any case for it.Yes, the book begins off comically, recounting stories of how he arrives to America and the trials and tribulations that ensue. In the early stages of the book, the stage is potentially set for an unfolding of important events and thus insight or life lessons, ingredients that would suit a memoir-type novel appropriately.As far as I could tell, what follows for the final 250 pages is a continuous reminder of how much of a sot Malachy was, even though it does prove destructive towards his familial affairs. This as much is even acknowledged by Malachy, though it may only be in retrospect.If this story provides 'true' accounts and anecdotes of Malachy's life, then it is fair enough to spare any criticism towards lack of plot. That being said, to maintain (at least my) interest, there must be some strategy and compulsion to engage the reader for the long haul. I found none. Rather, I tried to find some comedy in the telling of his stories, and kept optimistic that there would be a valuable lesson or perhaps some epiphany on Malachy's part from his lifelong moral transgressions.Not likely.Just as Malachy liked to imbibe and 'dip the wick' to his fulfillment, this book just seems to be an opportunity to bask in his conceit, using his childhood misfortunes as blame for his moral degradation.I give this review 2 stars because he does provide some momentary humour, and he uses the English language in a creative way to describe situations and express himself.Beyond this, I have even less respect or admiration for Malachy McCourt than before I had read this.I'm not sure whether that was his intention.P.S. I am Irish-Canadian, not too different from the ancestral background of Malachy, and I find it is quite unnecessary to perpetuate the stereotype of Irishmen as being disgraceful drunks and morons. Didn't his brother Frank McCourt already profit enough of this exploit in his series of novels before this one? (e.g. Angela's Ashes, 'Tis, etc.)\",\n",
       "   '\"Hastily, I transferred the snow to the burning part of the mattress and extinguished it, I thought, but an hour or so after I went back to sleep, the smoke revisited me. Bounding out of the bed again, I went for a jug of water and sloshed it all over the spifflicated Paterson. The man hardly stirred, but my mission was complete : Fire Out! and back to bed.Sometime later I was awakened abruptly and rudely by a rough hand shaking and thumping me. When I opened my eyes to see who it was that had the temerity to behave thusly, I almost had the cardiac seizure. I saw a head crowned wit spikes of ice, icily protruding eyebrows and eyelashes, icicled dripping from the nose. In a very high, indignant voice, the arctic apparition informed me that he was nearly frozen to death. Never in his life had he been subjected to such a horrible place, and he was leaving, and there was no point in trying to stop him.\"\"In Zurich… Everything was neat and symmetrical and orderly, and not a thing in sight to disturb the color scheme. Flowers, shrubs, and plants all clipped and leaning in unison to the direction of the unseen hand. There were people washing and hosing pavements, cleaning windows, polishing bells, painting walls, and generally doing violence to the natural orders of things. A weed poking its cheery little head up through a crack in a footpath would be cause for mobilization of the Swiss Army and their knives.\"This book is the memoirs of Malachy McCourt, who I’d never heard of before I read this book. His brother is the author of Anglela’s Ashes, which I have not read.A lot of this book was funny, really really funny. But then the rest was just his sad and slightly pathetic existence of drinking and making an ass of himself. It was the drunken tales of an alcoholic. The end was him screaming at his Father for being a drunk that abandoned his family, yet really, it was the same thing he had done. And that was it. It never went on to say if he became a good father - you know, one that didn’t leave the country for months on end, and didn’t spend every penny he had on the sauce, or ever got his shit together.So beside some of the funny scenes, the beginning romanticized alcoholism, and the end was incomplete. Maybe that\\'s because it was a memoir and he wasn\\'t dead. Who knows.',\n",

That isn't reason to give this book a 2 star rating though.The rating is because the book is a shallow account of a shallow man who in writing this book is a name dropping account of his tenuous stardom.The book started of well enough; McCourt can be a very clever writer but it just got so egotistical- how many women he could and did sleep with, how many drinks he could and did drink. how many people he could and did swear at, how many well known people he could and did insult.
